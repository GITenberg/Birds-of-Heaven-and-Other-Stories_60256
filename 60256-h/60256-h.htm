<h2>INTRODUCTION</h2>

<p>Of all of the more modern authors of Russia,
perhaps none holds a higher rank than Vladimir
Galaktionovich Korolenko. He was born in 1853
in Zhitomir, in the southern part of the Government
of Volhynia.</p>

<p>His works show an extensive knowledge of Russia,
through which he travelled very extensively
(partly due to the fact that he was one time banished
for political reasons), and a very keen appreciation
of the beauties and moods of nature. Even
more than this, however, he appreciates very keenly
the hardships and pleasures of the life of the people
and while depicting them realistically, he succeeds
in casting over even sordid and unpleasant
scenes, a veil of poetic beauty and of spiritual
significance, which elevate his work above much of
that produced by his contemporaries.</p>

<p>The stories in this volume date from the last
part of the nineteenth century, for the most part,
and give a very good idea of the range and variety
of the themes handled by Korolenko and of the
almost mystical treatment which he sometimes employs
and his works in this respect are, if anything,
more typically Russian than are those of his
contemporaries who strive for a brutal and often
repulsive realism.</p>

<h3>BIRDS OF HEAVEN</h3>

<h4>I</h4>

<p class="dropcap">That day the monastery was joyously greeting
the ikon. For two months the “Lady”
had been traveling from place to place and now
she was returning home.</p>

<p>First in their three-horse coaches came the priests
who had accompanied her and who were now bringing
back to the monastery the treasure which they
had collected on their travels. They looked
healthy, well-fed, and satisfied. They were followed
by the motley bands of pilgrims. These
came in greater and greater numbers out of the
forest, until at last the climax was reached with
the gilded covering of the ikon flashing in the sunlight
above the heads of the marchers.</p>

<p>Bells pealed forth; banners gleamed and waved;
the singing of the choir and the tramping of thousands
of men, like an onrushing river, filled the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_4" id="Page_4">[4]</a></span>
quiet neighborhood of the monastery with uproar
and confusion.</p>

<p>The place awoke. In the church hymns of
thanksgiving were sung. On the square merchants
and market women called out their wares from
under their linen curtains; from the “institution”
came the sounds of harmonicas and cymbals; in the
huts of the village one set of pilgrims kept replacing
another at the tables on which steamed enormous
samovars.</p>

<p>Towards evening a hard rain suddenly came up
and drove the crowds and the merchants from the
bazaar. The square and the streets became quiet
and no sound was to be heard save the splashing of
the huge drops in the puddles and the flapping and
blowing of the wet curtains, as they were tossed
by the storm wind. Yes, and in the church the harmonious
singing still continued and the yellow
lights of the candles still flickered on.</p>

<p>When the clouds suddenly lifted and streamed
off to the east, carrying with them the veil of mist
which had hung over the fields and woods, the sun
reappeared in the west and with its parting rays it
tenderly caressed the windows of the village and
the crosses of the monastery. But the earlier bustle
did not return to the square of the bazaar. The
pilgrims all had a quiet thirst for rest after their<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_5" id="Page_5">[5]</a></span>
hard journey and the day ended with the last notes
of the concluding service in the church. Even the
cymbals behind the wall of the “institution”
clashed weakly and dully.</p>

<p>The service was ended. Within the church the
candles burned out one after the other. The pilgrims
scattered. Little groups of men and
women stood at the door of the guest-house of
the monastery, until the guest-master should grant
admission to those who desired lodging. A fat
monk and two lay brothers came out on the porch
and began to divide the sheep from the goats. The
sheep entered the door; the goats were driven off
and, muttering, made their way to the gates. At
the end of this operation, there remained by the
entrance a group of Mordvin women and a wanderer.
Apparently, their fate had already been
decided by the guest-master who reëntered the
building.</p>

<p>In a moment the lay brothers came out, counted
the women and admitted them to the women’s
apartments. The older lay brother walked up to
the solitary stranger and said with a bow:</p>

<p>“Forgive me, for Christ’s sake, Brother Varsonofy....
The guest-master will not permit you
to stay here.... Go in peace.”</p>

<p>A sick smile passed over the face of the young<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_6" id="Page_6">[6]</a></span>
wanderer and I was surprised by its peculiar, dramatic,
and significant character. The man’s face
was also worthy of notice: hump-nosed, thin, and
with large, glowing eyes. A pointed hat and a
hardly noticeable, but pointed, beard gave the man
an unusual appearance. The whole dry figure
dressed in an old cassock, with a thin neck and a
strong profile, attracted your attention, even
against your will. The impression which it produced
was clear, alarming and disturbing.</p>

<p>When he heard the words of the lay brother, the
stranger bowed and said:</p>

<p>“God will save and for this....”</p>

<p>As he turned to go, he suddenly staggered. He
was clearly sick and extremely tired. The good-hearted
lay brother looked at him and hesitated.</p>

<p>“Wait, Brother Varsonofy.... I will try
again.”</p>

<p>The stranger rested on his staff and waited expectantly.
But in a moment the brother again came
out and, walking up with some embarrassment,
said with evident pity:</p>

<p>“No, he won’t allow it.... Father Nifont told
him that a stranger ... like you ... speaks
badly ... disturbs the people.”</p>

<p>The stranger’s face showed how he felt. His<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_7" id="Page_7">[7]</a></span>
eyes flashed, as if he were about to speak, but he
bowed and said:</p>

<p>“Thank you, fathers....”</p>

<p>And he wearily went from the door.</p>

<p>The lay brother looked at me questioningly. I
knew that he was about to shut the gate and so I
went to the outer court. This was already empty.
The young man who sold kalaches (cakes) for the
monastery was behind his stand, but no one came
to it.</p>

<p>The porter closed one gate behind me and then,
pressing with his feet, he started to close the second.
Just then a scuffle was heard within the gate,
the tramping of several pairs of feet; the opening
again widened and in it appeared an ill-favored
figure in a pilgrim’s costume, reddish and faded.
A rough, hairy hand held it by the collar and directed
its involuntary movements. A vigorous
push.... The stranger flew off several paces and
fell. One wallet and then another sailed after
him.... A small book in a worn leather binding
fell out in the mud and its leaves commenced to
blow in the wind.</p>

<p>“Look here, ...” said a deep, bass voice behind
the gate. “Don’t quarrel....”</p>

<p>“What’s the matter?” asked the porter.</p>

<p>“Why, this,” answered the bass voice. “Because<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_8" id="Page_8">[8]</a></span>
of him the guest-master sinned ... turned
a man away.... And he’s a good man. Oh!
Oh!... a real sin....”</p>

<p>The speaker went away. The porter shut the
gate, but not quite completely; curiosity mastered
him and his little eyes, his fat nose, and his light
mustache could be seen through the crack. He
was following with manifest interest the further
actions of the rejected wanderer.</p>

<p>The latter quickly rose, gathered up his wallets,
put one on his back, and threw the other over his
shoulder. Then, picking up the book, he carefully
began to clean the mud off of it. Looking around
the court, he caught sight of me and of the kalach-seller.
A group of peasants were watching the little
drama from the outer gates of the square. Deliberately
the stranger assumed an air of dignity,
and, with the most demonstrative devotion, he
kissed the binding of the book and made a sarcastic
bow toward the inner gates.</p>

<p>“I thank you, holy fathers. As ye have received
the stranger and fed the hungry....”</p>

<p>Suddenly noticing in the crack of the gate the
mustache and nose of the porter, he said in a different
tone:</p>

<p>“What are you looking at? Did you recognize
me?”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_9" id="Page_9">[9]</a></span></p>

<p>“I thought ... yes ... I thought you were familiar,”
said the porter.</p>

<p>“Of course, of course!... We’re old friends!
We ran off together to the Mordvin women of Sviridov....
Do you remember now?”</p>

<p>The porter spat loudly and angrily, closed the
gate, and threw the bolt. But his feet, with their
rough boots, could still be seen beneath the gate.</p>

<p>“Don’t you remember Fenka, father?”</p>

<p>The feet disappeared as if ashamed.</p>

<p>The stranger straightened his muddy cloak and
again looked around. Attracted by the unusual
conversation, some six peasants had strolled towards
the gate. They were the nearest neighbors
to the monastery, Old Believers from the villages
in the vicinity, who had come to the bazaar with an
air of indifferent and even hostile curiosity. Despite
its influence at a distance, the monastery was
surrounded by a ring of the “most venomous”
sectarians, as the monks expressed it. The inhabitants
of the region were positive that in the near
future the monastery would be threatened with the
fate of Sodom and Gomorrah. But still it continued
and attracted thousands of people to
its festivals. On such days the figures of the
Old Believers furnished a grim contrast to the rejoicing
multitudes and their faces reflected their<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_10" id="Page_10">[10]</a></span>
hostility and disgust. Like the Prophet Jonah,
they murmured because the Lord delayed in inflicting
the promised doom upon the accursed
Nineveh.</p>

<p>They were now watching with malevolent curiosity
the scene which was being enacted at the door
of the dishonorable habitation.</p>

<p>“What’s the matter? They won’t let him in, I
see, ...” one said jokingly. “It’s crowded ...
with Mordvin women....”</p>

<p>The wanderer turned and threw a keen glance at
the speaker. Suddenly his face took on a humble
expression and he walked back to the gate,—and
three times he crossed himself reverently and ostentatiously.</p>

<p>The peasants looked at one another in surprise;
the stranger had made the sign of the cross not
with three fingers, but in the old way with only
two.</p>

<p>“The Lord, Who seest all things, will reward the
monks according to their mercy,” he said with a
sigh. “We, brothers, will shake off the dust from
our feet, and listen here, in the temple not made
with hands (he pointed gracefully and calmly to
the evening sky), to an instructive sermon on repentance....”</p>

<p>The peasants crowded together; their faces expressed<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_11" id="Page_11">[11]</a></span>
their delighted and also credulous surprise.
The change was too unexpected.... The
idea of holding their own meeting on the alien festival
and of listening at the very gate of the monastery
to a wandering preacher, who made the sign
of the cross in the old way, clearly pleased the adherents
of the old faith. The preacher took his
stand at the base of the bell-tower. The wind ruffled
his dusty, light hair.</p>

<p>It was hard to tell the man’s precise age, but
he was clearly not old. His face was heavily tanned
and his hair and eyes seemed faded from the action
of sun and storm.</p>

<p>At each movement of his head, however slight,
the cords of his neck stood out prominently and
trembled. The man gave you, involuntarily, the
impression of something unfortunate, wonderfully
self-controlled and, perchance, evil.</p>

<p>He began to read aloud. He read well, simply,
and convincingly, and, stopping now and then, he
commented in his own way on what he had read.
Once he glanced at me, but he quickly shifted his
eyes. I thought he did not care for my presence.
After that he turned more often to one of his auditors.</p>

<p>This was a broad-shouldered, undersized peasant,
whose shape might have been fashioned by two<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_12" id="Page_12">[12]</a></span>
or three blows of an axe. In spite of the squareness
of his figure, he seemed very communicative.
He paid the utmost attention to every word
of the preacher and added some remarks of
his own, which expressed his almost childish
joy.</p>

<p>“Oh, brothers ... my friends,” he said, looking
around.... “It’s so true, what he told us
about repentance.... The end might come....
You know ... and we’re such sinners ... just
one little sin more and another. Yes, yes....”</p>

<p>“And that means another and another, ...”
broke in a second.</p>

<p>“Yes.... You see.... Oh!...”</p>

<p>With delighted eyes, he looked around the gathering....</p>

<p>His noisy interruption and his joy apparently
did not please the preacher. The latter suddenly
stopped, turned his head quickly, and the cords of
his neck tightened like ropes.... He wanted to say
something, but he checked himself and turned
a page.</p>

<p>The congregation had rejoiced too early. At the
very time when they were most highly exalted,—pride
and excessive hope pressed hard on the ladder.
It trembled; the listeners seemed frightened;
the ladder crashed down....</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_13" id="Page_13">[13]</a></span></p>

<p>“He’s through!” were the sad words of the deep-voiced
peasant.</p>

<p>“Yes, brother!” chimed in the first. And a
strange thing: he turned his sparkling eyes on all
and the same joy sounded in his voice.... “Now
we have no excuse.... We mustn’t do that first
little sin.”</p>

<p>The stranger closed his book and for a few seconds
he watched the speaker obstinately. But the
peasant met his gaze with the same joy and trusting
good nature.</p>

<p>“Do you think so?” asked the preacher.</p>

<p>“Yes,” answered the man. “Judge yourself,
my friend.... How long will He suffer us?”</p>

<p>“Do you think so?” the preacher asked again
with some emphasis, and his voice caused signs of
uneasiness to appear on the other’s face.</p>

<p>“You know there are limits to the long suffering
of God. You know about the Orthodox Catholic
Church.”</p>

<p>He turned a few pages and began to read about
the spiritual power of the Orthodox Church. The
faces of his hearers darkened. The preacher
stopped and said:</p>

<p>“The Orthodox Catholic Church.... Is she
not the means of salvation? He who seeks refuge
in her need not despair. So ... if....”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_14" id="Page_14">[14]</a></span></p>

<p>A tense silence prevailed for a few seconds. The
stranger was facing the crowd of peasants and he
felt that he held their feelings in his hands. Not
long since, they had been following him joyfully
and it was not hard to foresee the results of the
sermon: the men of the old faith had been ready to
invite to their homes the man who had been driven
from the monastery. Now they were dumbfounded
and did not know what to think.</p>

<p>“But if,” continued the stranger, accenting each
word, “any one rejects the one Mother Church ...
expects to be saved in cellars with the rats ... if
he trusts in shaved heads....”</p>

<p>The peasant with the deep voice suddenly turned
and walked away.</p>

<p>His good-natured companion glanced around
with an air of disillusionment and a lack of comprehension
and said half-questioningly:</p>

<p>“Are you shocked?... Oh! Oh! Oh! Oh!...”</p>

<p>He followed the others. The sectarians grimly
went to the gates. The wanderer remained alone.
His figure was outlined sharply against the base of
the tower and there was a strange expression in his
faded blue eyes. Evidently he had intended to
gain by his sermon that lodging which the monks
had denied him. Why had he suddenly changed
his tone?...</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_15" id="Page_15">[15]</a></span></p>

<p>There were now only three of us in the yard: the
wanderer, I and the young fellow under the curtain
of the booth. The stranger glanced at me but
at once turned away and walked up to the dealer.
The young man’s face beamed with joy....</p>

<p>“That was clever,” he said. “You shocked them
well. They all had their heads shaved. The devils
were threshing peas. Ha, ha, ha!”</p>

<p>He broke out into a hearty, youthful laugh and
started to put his wares within the shop.</p>

<p>When he had finished, he closed the swinging
doors and locked them. The shop was well made
and adapted for moving,—it was on wheels and
had a low shelf. The fellow evidently intended to
sleep by his wares.</p>

<p>“Well, it’s time to go to bed,” he said, looking
at the sky.</p>

<p>In the yard and behind the gates all was still
and deserted. From the bazaar the wares had all
been carried away. The fellow faced the church,
crossed himself, opened the door a little way and
crawled under his stand.</p>

<p>His hands soon appeared. He was trying to put
a small screen over the opening.</p>

<p>The stranger also looked up at the sky, thought
a few seconds, and walked resolutely up to the
shop.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_16" id="Page_16">[16]</a></span></p>

<p>“Wait, Mikhailo! I’ll help you like a good
fellow.”</p>

<p>The pale-faced man let go and looked out of his
quarters.</p>

<p>“My name’s Anton,” he said simply.</p>

<p>“Come, Antosha, let me help you.”</p>

<p>“I’m very glad; thank you. It’s hard to do it
from here.”</p>

<p>Anton’s simple face disappeared.</p>

<p>“Please ... move your feet a little.”</p>

<p>Anton obeyed. The wanderer quietly opened the
door, stooped quickly, and, to my amazement, I
saw him step nimbly into the opening. A scuffle
ensued. Anton moved his feet and part of the
stranger appeared outside for a moment, but without
any delay and almost instantaneously he disappeared
again within.</p>

<p>Interested by this unexpected turn of events, I
almost instinctively walked up to the booth.</p>

<p>“I’ll yell, I’ll yell,” I heard the nasal but pitiful
voice of Anton. “The fathers will beat you up
again!”</p>

<p>“Don’t yell, Misha. What’s the matter?”
argued the wanderer.</p>

<p>“Why do you keep calling me Misha? I tell
you my name’s Anton.”</p>

<p>“In the monastic jargon your name will be<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_17" id="Page_17">[17]</a></span>
Mikhailo. Remember that.... Hush! Quiet,
Anton, keep still.”</p>

<p>The booth became silent.</p>

<p>“What for?” asked Anton. “What do you
hear?”</p>

<p>“Listen, hear the tapping.... It’s raining.”</p>

<p>“Well, what of it? Tapping.... If I let
out one shout, the fathers will tap harder on
you.”</p>

<p>“Why do you keep harping on one thing? I’ll
yell and yell. You’d better not. If you do, I’ll
eat you up. I’ll tell you a good story about a
nun....”</p>

<p>“I see, you’ve been stealing something.”</p>

<p>“It’s wrong, Antosha, for you to slander a
stranger. You gave me this one kalach yourself.
I ate nothing—you believe God....”</p>

<p>“Go ahead and eat a stale one.... I haven’t
eaten them up,” and Anton yawned so hard that
he gave up all thoughts of further resistance.</p>

<p>“You shocked those blockheads well,” he added
at the end of his strenuous yawn. “You’ve certainly
showed them up.”</p>

<p>“And the fathers?”</p>

<p>“The fathers wanted to spit at you.... You
promised to tell me a story. Why don’t you
do it?”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_18" id="Page_18">[18]</a></span></p>

<p>“In a certain country, in a certain land,” began
the stranger, “in a convent with a stone wall, lived
a nun, brother Antoshenka.... And such a nun....
Oh, oh, oh!”</p>

<p>“Yes?...”</p>

<p>“Yes, she lived there, and grieved.”</p>

<p>Silence.</p>

<p>“Well?... Go on.”</p>

<p>Silence again.</p>

<p>“Well, go on. What did she grieve about?”
insisted the interested Anton.</p>

<p>“Go to the devil, that’s what! Why did I start
a story? You know I hoofed it thirty versts to-day.
She grieved about you, you fool, that’s what she
did. Let me sleep!”</p>

<p>Anton let out a sound of utter exhaustion.</p>

<p>“Well, you’re a rogue. I see your scheme,” he
said reproachfully.</p>

<p>“All right, knave,” a minute later but more
softly, and even sorrowfully. “Yes, a knave....
I never saw such a knave before.”</p>

<p>All was quiet in the booth. The rain beat harder
and harder on the slanting roof, the earth grew
black, the puddles disappeared in the darkness.
The monastery garden whispered something, and
the buildings behind the wall stood defenceless
against the rain, which pattered on the gutters.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_19" id="Page_19">[19]</a></span>
The guard within the enclosure beat upon his wet
rattle.</p>

<h4>II</h4>

<p>The next day I started back with Andrey Ivanovich,
who had accompanied me on many of my
wanderings. We had been walking not without
having interesting experiences, lodged in the village,
and started off again rather late. The pilgrims
had already left and it was hard to imagine
the crowds which had passed by such a little while
before. The villages seemed busy; the workmen
could be seen as white spots on the fields. The
air was muggy and hot.</p>

<p>My companion, a tall, thin, nervous man, was
this day especially gloomy and irritable. This
was a not at all uncommon state towards the end
of our joint trips. But this day he was unusually
out of humor and expressed his personal disapproval
of me.</p>

<p>Towards afternoon, in the heat, we became completely
disgusted with each other. Andrey Ivanovich
either thought it necessary to rest without
any reason in the most inappropriate places, or
wished to push on, when I proposed stopping.</p>

<p>We finally reached a little bridge. A small<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_20" id="Page_20">[20]</a></span>
stream was flowing quietly between the damp green
banks with their nodding heads of grass. The
stream wound along and disappeared behind a bend
amid the waving grain of the meadows.</p>

<p>“Let’s rest,” I said.</p>

<p>“We’ve got to be getting on,” answered Andrey
Ivanovich.</p>

<p>I sat down on the railing and began to smoke.
The tall figure of Andrey Ivanovich went on,
ascended a hill and disappeared.</p>

<p>I bent over the water and began to meditate. I
thought I was absolutely alone, but I suddenly felt
that some one was looking at me and then on a hill
under some birch trees, I saw two men. One had a
small and almost childish face. He at once hid
from shame in the grass behind the crest of the
hill. The other was the preacher of the preceding
evening. As he lay on the grass, he quietly turned
his bold, gray eyes upon me.</p>

<p>“Come, join us, we’ll have more fun together,”
he said simply.</p>

<p>I got up and to my surprise I saw the feet of
Andrey Ivanovich sticking out of the grass by
the road; he was sitting nearby in the boundary
strip, and his cigar smoke was rising above the
tops of the grass. I pretended not to see him and
walked up to the strangers.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_21" id="Page_21">[21]</a></span></p>

<p>The one whom I had taken for a child proved to
be a young, sickly creature in a striped cassock,
with thin hair around his narrow, sallow face and
a nose like a bird’s beak. He kept straightening
his cassock, was uneasy, kept moving around and
was clearly ashamed of his condition.</p>

<p>“Sit down and be our guest,” the preacher suggested
with a slight gesture. Just then the tall
figure of Andrey Ivanovich rose like the shade of
Banquo above the grain.</p>

<p>“Let’s be going!” he said in a not very kind
tone of voice, as he threw away the butt of his
cigar.</p>

<p>“I’ll stay here,” I answered.</p>

<p>“I see you like those parasites better....” And
Andrey Ivanovich glanced at me sorrowfully, as
if he wished to impress upon me the impropriety
of my choice.</p>

<p>“Yes, there’s more fun here,” I answered.</p>

<p>“I’m through with you. I hope you remain in
good company.”</p>

<p>He pulled his cap down over his face and started
off with long strides, but he soon stopped, came
back, and said angrily:</p>

<p>“Don’t ask me again! You rascal, I’ll never go
with you again. Don’t you dare to ask me! I
refuse.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_22" id="Page_22">[22]</a></span></p>

<p>“It’s my business whether I ask you or not....
Yours is to go or not.”</p>

<p>“A serious-minded gentleman!” The wanderer
nodded after him as he started off.</p>

<p>“He doesn’t approve of us,” the little man said
in a voice that was between a sigh and a squeak.</p>

<p>“What do we care whether he does or not?”
remarked the preacher indifferently. Then he
turned to me:</p>

<p>“Haven’t you a cigarette, sir?... Please.”</p>

<p>I held out my case to him. He took out two
cigarettes, lighted one and placed the other beside
him. His small companion interpreted this in a
favorable way and rather irresolutely reached for
the free cigarette. But the preacher, with perfect
composure, took the cigarette out of his hands and
placed it on the other side. The little fellow was
embarrassed, again squeaked from shame and
straightened his robes.</p>

<p>I gave him a cigarette. This embarrassed him
still more,—his thin, transparent fingers trembled;
he smiled sadly and bashfully.</p>

<p>“I don’t know how to beg,” he said in shame.
“Avtonomov orders and orders.... But I can’t.”</p>

<p>“Who’s this Avtonomov?” I asked.</p>

<p>“That’s me,—Gennady Avtonomov,” said the
preacher with a stern glance at his small companion,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_23" id="Page_23">[23]</a></span>
who quailed under the glance and dropped
his sallow face. His thin hair fell and rose.</p>

<p>“Are you walking for your health, or why?”
Avtonomov asked me.</p>

<p>“Because I want to.... Where are you going?”</p>

<p>He looked into the distance and answered:</p>

<p>“To Paris or nearer, to Italy or further....”
And, noticing that I did not understand, he
added:</p>

<p>“I was joking.... I am wandering aimlessly
wherever it suits me. For eleven years——”</p>

<p>He spoke with a faint touch of sadness. Then
he quietly exhaled some tobacco smoke and
watched the blue clouds melt away in the air. His
face had a new expression, a quality I had never
noticed before.</p>

<p>“A wasted life, signor! A ruined existence,
which deserved a better lot.”</p>

<p>The sadness disappeared and he concluded
grandiloquently, with a flourish of his cigarette:</p>

<p>“Yet, good sir, the wanderer will never be willing
to exchange his liberty for luxurious palaces.”</p>

<p>Just then a bold little bird flew over our heads
like a clod of earth thrown up into the air, perched
on the lowest branch of the birch, and began to
twitter without paying any attention to our presence.
The face of the little wanderer brightened<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_24" id="Page_24">[24]</a></span>
and was suffused with a ludicrous kindness. He
kept time with his thin lips and, at the successful
completion of any tune, he looked at us with triumphant,
smiling, and weeping eyes.</p>

<p>“O God!” he said finally, when the bird flew
away at the end of its song. “A creature of God.
It sang as much as it needed to, it praised Him,
and flew off on its own business. O darling!...
Yes, by heaven, that’s right.”</p>

<p>He looked at us joyfully, and then became embarrassed,
stopped talking, and straightened his
cassock, but Avtonomov waved his hand and added
like a teacher:</p>

<p>“Behold the birds of heaven. We, signor, are
the same kind of birds. We sow not, neither do we
reap, nor gather into barns....”</p>

<p>“You studied in the seminary?” I asked.</p>

<p>“Yes. I could tell a lot about that; only there’s
little worth hearing. But, as you see, the horizon
is being covered with clouds. Up, Ivan Ivanovich;
rise, comrade, rise. The portion of the wanderer
is journeying, not resting. Let us wish you every
sort of blessing.”</p>

<p>He nodded and started rapidly along the road.
He took free, even strides, leaning on a long staff
and thrusting it back with every step. The wind
blew out the skirts of his cassock, he bent forward<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_25" id="Page_25">[25]</a></span>
under his wallet, and his wedge-shaped beard projected
in front. It seemed as if this sun-burned,
dried, and faded figure had been created for the
poor Russian plain with the dark villages in the
distance and the clouds which thoughtfully gathered
in the sky.</p>

<p>“A scholar!” Ivan Ivanovich shook his head
sadly as he tied up his wallet with trembling hands.
“A most learned man! But he falls to nothing
just as I. On the same plane ... we wander together.
God forgive us, the last....”</p>

<p>“Why?”</p>

<p>“Why? How? The modern wanderer has a
good wallet, a cassock or kaftan, boots, for example,—in
a word, equipment for every circumstance,
so to speak. And we! You see yourself. I’m
coming, I’m coming, Gennady Sergeich, I’m coming.
Right away!”</p>

<p>The little fellow soon overtook his companion.
Thinking that they had reasons for not inviting
me to accompany them, I kept sitting on the hill,
and watching a heavy, dark cloud rise from behind
the woods and spread quietly, sadly, imperceptibly,
almost stealthily over the sky, and then I went
on alone, regretting the controversy with Andrey
Ivanovich.</p>

<p>It was quiet and sad. The grain waved and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_26" id="Page_26">[26]</a></span>
rustled drily. In the distance, behind the woods,
growled the thunder and at times a large drop of
rain fell.</p>

<p>It was an empty threat. Towards evening I
came to the village of K. and it had not rained
yet, but the cloud was advancing quietly and
spreading out; it grew dark and the thunder
sounded nearer and nearer.</p>

<h4>III</h4>

<p>To my surprise, on the bank of earth around one
of the first huts of the village, I saw Andrey
Ivanovich, with his long legs reaching almost to
the very middle of the street. As I approached,
he looked utterly unconcerned.</p>

<p>“What are you doing, Andrey Ivanovich?”</p>

<p>“Drinking tea. Did you think I was waiting
for you? Don’t flatter yourself. When the cloud
passes, I’m going on.”</p>

<p>“Fine.”</p>

<p>“And your adored——”</p>

<p>“Who?”</p>

<p>“Those wanderers, people of God.... Please
see what they’re doing in that hut! Go, look:
it’s nothing; don’t be ashamed....”</p>

<p>I walked up to the window. The hut was full.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_27" id="Page_27">[27]</a></span>
The peasants of the village were all away on business
and so there were only women present. A
few young women and girls were still running
back and forth past me. The windows were open
and illuminated, and I could hear within the even
voice of Avtonomov. He was teaching the dissenters.</p>

<p>“Come, join us,” I suddenly heard the low voice
of Ivan Ivanovich. He was standing in a dark
corner near the gate.</p>

<p>“What are you doing?”</p>

<p>“Fooling the people. That’s what they’re
doing,” interrupted Andrey Ivanovich.</p>

<p>The little wanderer coughed, and, squinting at
Andrey Ivanovich, he said:</p>

<p>“What can we do, sir?”</p>

<p>He bent toward me and whispered:</p>

<p>“The old dissenters think Gennady Sergeich is
a runaway priest. It’s dark. What can we do?
We may not get anything. And, besides, there’s
nothing else to do. Won’t you come in?”</p>

<p>“Let’s go in, Andrey Ivanovich.”</p>

<p>“What I haven’t seen there?” he answered,
turning away. “Go,—kiss them. I think enough
of myself not to do this, for I wear a cross.”</p>

<p>“So do we,” Ivan Ivanovich spoke with a mild
tone of reproach.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_28" id="Page_28">[28]</a></span></p>

<p>Andrey Ivanovich whistled suspiciously, and
then, with a serious look on his face, he called
to me:</p>

<p>“Do you know this disreputable crowd?”</p>

<p>With an enigmatic glance at me, he added in a
lower tone:</p>

<p>“Did you understand?”</p>

<p>“No, I didn’t. Good-bye. If you want to, wait
for me.”</p>

<p>“We’ve nothing to wait for. Some people don’t
understand....”</p>

<p>I didn’t hear the rest of the sentence, because I
went into the hut with Ivan Ivanovich.</p>

<p>Our entrance caused some excitement. The
preacher noticed me and stopped.</p>

<p>“Oh! We thank you,” he said, pushing the
women aside. “Please. Won’t you have a little
cup of tea? Here’s the samovar, even though it’s
a dissenting village.”</p>

<p>“Did I disturb you?”</p>

<p>“What nonsense. Woman, bring the samovar!
Quick!”</p>

<p>“Do you use that weed, too?” asked a young
woman with a full bosom and bashful, coal-black
eyes, who was standing in the front.</p>

<p>“If the gentleman will permit,—it will give me
pleasure, ... and I’ll drink another....”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_29" id="Page_29">[29]</a></span></p>

<p>“If you please,” I said.</p>

<p>“Please give me a cigarette.”</p>

<p>I gave it to him. He lighted it and looked
laughingly at the surprised women. A murmur of
dissatisfaction ran through the hut.</p>

<p>“Do you suck that?” asked the young woman
spitefully.</p>

<p>“Of course.... According to the Scriptures,
it is permitted.”</p>

<p>“In what part?—teach us, please.”</p>

<p>He smoked on and then he threw the cigarette
over the heads of the women into a basin of water.</p>

<p>“He’s thrown it away,” said the hostess, fussing
around the samovar.</p>

<p>“Don’t throw it away, fool; you’ll set the place
on fire,” interrupted another.</p>

<p>“Afire? If the well won’t stop that, you’d
better put out the fire in the kitchen.”</p>

<p>“What are you thinking of? Everything is
done nowadays. Even the priests smoke.”</p>

<p>“Of course, of course. You’ve a voice like a
bell. You ought to be in a convent choir. Come
with me.”</p>

<p>He reached for her. She cleverly turned aside,
bending her beautiful form, while the other women,
laughing and spitting, ran out of the hut.</p>

<p>“W-what a priest,” said a thin woman with<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_30" id="Page_30">[30]</a></span>
childishly open eyes. She was in evident terror.
“T-teacher!”</p>

<p>“Yes, he’ll teach us.”</p>

<p>“Teach us,” laughed a soldier’s wife, coming
forward and resting her cheek on her fat hand.
“Teach us something easy and sweet.”</p>

<p>“Yes! We’ll sigh for you.”</p>

<p>“I’ll teach you. What is your name, beauty?”</p>

<p>“I’m called what I’m called and nicknamed
Gray Duck. What do you want?”</p>

<p>“You, Gray Duck. Give us some vodka,—heavens,
they’ll pay up.”</p>

<p>“Get what? We’ll get it.”</p>

<p>She looked at me questioningly and cunningly.</p>

<p>“Please, a little,” I said.</p>

<p>The soldier’s wife hurried from the hut. Laughing
and pushing, two or three women ran out
after her. The hostess looked displeased but she
put the samovar on the table and without a word
she sat down on the bench and commenced to work.
The children watched us curiously from their plank
beds.</p>

<p>Laughing and panting, the soldier’s wife put on
the table a bottle of some sort of greenish liquid.
Then she walked away from the table and looked
at us laughingly and boldly. Ivan Ivanovich
coughed from embarrassment and the temporary<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_31" id="Page_31">[31]</a></span>
widows still in the hut gazed at us in secret expectation.
After the first cups, the preacher of
the evening lifted the skirts of his cassock and
stamped around the Gray Duck, who avoided his
caresses.</p>

<p>“Go away!” She waved her hand, and, with a
provokingly challenging glance at me, she walked
up to the table.</p>

<p>“Why don’t you drink? Look at them,—they’ll
finish it, I bet. Go ahead and drink.”</p>

<p>Smiling and shrugging her shoulders, she filled
a glass and brought it to me.</p>

<p>“Don’t drink!” These words, in an unexpectedly
venomous tone, came through the window, and
out of the darkness appeared the bony face of
Andrey Ivanovich.</p>

<p>“Don’t drink the vodka, I tell you!” he repeated,
still more sternly, and again disappeared
in the darkness.</p>

<p>The soldier’s wife let the glass tremble and
spill. Thoroughly frightened she looked out of the
window.</p>

<p>“May the power of the cross help us,—what
was that?”</p>

<p>Everyone felt ill at ease. The vodka was exhausted
and the question was whether to get more
and continue, or to end now. Ivan Ivanovich<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_32" id="Page_32">[32]</a></span>
looked at me in timid sorrow, but I had not the
slightest desire to continue this feast. Avtonomov
suddenly understood this.</p>

<p>“Really,—it’s time to be going,” he said, walking
towards the window.</p>

<p>“But it’s raining outdoors,” said the soldier’s
wife, glancing to one side.</p>

<p>“No. The clouds are all right; ... they look
dry.... Get ready, Ivan Ivanovich.”</p>

<p>We began to get ready. Ivan Ivanovich went
out first. When I followed him into the dark,
closed yard, he took my hand and said in a low
tone:</p>

<p>“There’s that long-legged fellow waiting by the
gate.”</p>

<p>In very truth I made out Andrey Ivanovich by
the entrance. Avtonomov, with his wallet and
staff, came out on the porch, holding the soldier’s
wife by the hand. Both figures could be seen in
the lighted doorway. The soldier’s wife did not
withdraw her hand.</p>

<p>“Are you going to leave us?” she said in despair.
“We thought—you’d carouse around here.”</p>

<p>“Wait, I’ll be back,—I’ll get rich.”</p>

<p>She looked at him and shook her head.</p>

<p>“Where? You’ll never get rich. You’ll get
along, empty....”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_33" id="Page_33">[33]</a></span></p>

<p>“Don’t caw, you crow.... Tell me this: does
Irina’s clerk still live by the cemetery?”</p>

<p>“Stchurovskaya? Yes. He just went to the
bazaar. What do you want?”</p>

<p>“This. Let’s see.... He had a daughter,
Grunyushka.”</p>

<p>“She’s married.”</p>

<p>“Nearby?”</p>

<p>“To a deacon in the village of Voskresenskoye.
The old woman’s there alone.”</p>

<p>“You say Irina’s husband hasn’t come back?”</p>

<p>“He hasn’t been seen.”</p>

<p>“Is he rich?”</p>

<p>“No, he lives like everyone else.”</p>

<p>“Good-bye!... Glasha-a!”</p>

<p>“Now, now! Don’t call.... You know Glasha
is good and not yours. Go along. There’s nothing
to hang around for.”</p>

<p>Kindly pity could be heard in the voice of the
village beauty.</p>

<p>Outside the dark figure of Andrey Ivanovich left
the gate and hurried towards us, while at the
same time Avtonomov overtook us and silently
went ahead of us.</p>

<p>“You should have stayed till morning,” remarked
Andrey Ivanovich grimly. “I could have
waited here!”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_34" id="Page_34">[34]</a></span></p>

<p>“That’s foolish,” I answered coldly.</p>

<p>“How so? Why?”</p>

<p>“Why?—you could have gone on if you didn’t
like it.”</p>

<p>“No, thanks for your kindness, I’m not willing
to leave a companion.... I’d rather suffer myself
than leave him.... We’ve been together three
years, Ivan Anisimovich. Trifles don’t count, I’ve
drunk so often in good company....”</p>

<p>“Yes?”</p>

<p>“They took off my vest; three rubles twenty....
A new pocket book....”</p>

<p>“If you’re blaming Gennady and me for this,”
began Ivan Ivanovich, hurriedly and excitedly,
“that’s so mean. Why?... If you have any
doubts, we can go ahead or stay behind....”</p>

<p>“Please don’t pay any attention,” I said, wishing
to quiet the poor fellow.</p>

<p>“What’s the matter?” asked Avtonomov, stopping.
“What are you talking about?”</p>

<p>“They’re so suspicious. Lord, have mercy upon
us! Are we really robbers, the Lord forgive the
word?”</p>

<p>Gennady gazed in the darkness into the face of
Andrey Ivanovich.</p>

<p>“Oh, the lanky gentleman!... I see!” he said
drily. “The man who never trusts has pleasure,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_35" id="Page_35">[35]</a></span>
if all he judges by his measure.’ ... The road
is broad....”</p>

<p>He again walked forward quickly and his timid
little companion ran after him. Andrey Ivanovich
waited for several seconds. He was surprised that
the stranger had answered in rhythm. He almost
started after him, but I caught his hand.</p>

<p>“What’s the matter with you?” I said angrily.</p>

<p>“You’re sorry for your good companions?” he
said spitefully. “Please, don’t be uneasy. They
won’t go far....”</p>

<p>In very truth we caught sight of a black figure
near the last houses. It was Ivan Ivanovich,
alone.</p>

<p>He was standing in the road, panting and
coughing and holding on to his breast.</p>

<p>“What’s the matter?” I asked sympathetically.</p>

<p>“Oh, oh! My death!... He went off....
Gennady.... He ordered me not to go with him....
To go with you. I can’t catch him.”</p>

<p>“That’s all right. Do you know the road?”</p>

<p>“It’s the broad road. He hurried on some
place or other.”</p>

<p>“Fine.”</p>

<p>We walked along in the darkness.... A dog
barked behind us; I looked around and saw in the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_36" id="Page_36">[36]</a></span>
darkness two or three lights in the village, but
they soon disappeared.</p>

<h4>IV</h4>

<p>It was a quiet, starless night. The horizon could
still be traced as an indistinct line beneath the
clouds, but still lower hung a thick mist, endless,
shapeless, without form or details.</p>

<p>We walked on quite a while in silence. The
wanderer panted timidly and tried to smother his
cough.</p>

<p>“I don’t see Avtonomov,” he kept saying, and
he gazed helplessly in the blackness of the
night.</p>

<p>“We can’t see him.... But he sees us, by
heavens,” said Andrey Ivanovich, spitefully and
ominously.</p>

<p>The road seemed to be a confused streak, like a
bridge across an abyss.... Everything around
was black and indistinct. Was there or was
there not a light streak on the horizon? There
was not a trace of it now. Was it so short a time,
since we were in that noisy hut with the laughter
and conversation?... Will there be any end to
this night, to this field? Were we moving ahead
or was the road like an endless ribbon slipping<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_37" id="Page_37">[37]</a></span>
by under our feet while we remained treading in
the same spot, in the same enchanted patch of
darkness? An involuntary, timid joy sprang up
in my soul when an unseen brook began to babble
ahead of us, when this murmur increased and then
died away behind us, or when a sudden breath of
wind stirred the scarcely visible clumps of willows
beside the road and then died away, a sign that we
had passed them....</p>

<p>“It’s night now all right,” said Andrey Ivanovich
quietly, and this was very unusual for him.
“A man’s a fool to walk the roads a night like
this. And what are we after, I’d like to know.
We worked during the day, rested, drank our tea,
prayed—for sleep. No, I don’t like it—and then
we started along the roads. It’s better for us.
Here it’s midnight and we haven’t crossed ourselves
yet. We certainly pray!...”</p>

<p>I made no answer. Thoughts of repentance
seemed still to be running through the head of
Andrey Ivanovich.</p>

<p>“Women can teach us a little,” he said sternly.
“We don’t stay at home. What do we want?...”</p>

<p>“Why, I can’t see Avtonomov,” interrupted
the plaintive voice of the young wanderer.</p>

<p>“Neither can I,” grunted Andrey Ivanovich.</p>

<p>“What a misfortune!” said the young wanderer<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_38" id="Page_38">[38]</a></span>
sorrowfully. “I’ve been abandoned by my
protector....”</p>

<p>His voice was so filled with despair that we
both looked ahead involuntarily in search of the
lost Avtonomov. Suddenly, rather to one side, we
heard a dull sound as if some one had stepped upon
an old bridge.</p>

<p>“There he is!” said Andrey Ivanovich. “He
went to the left.”</p>

<p>“The road must have turned.”</p>

<p>In truth the road soon forked. We also turned
to the left. Ivan Ivanovich sighed from relief.</p>

<p>“What are you grieving so over?” asked Andrey
Ivanovich. “Is he your brother or who is he?
He’s a freak, begging your pardon.”</p>

<p>“He’s closer than a brother. I’d be lost without
him; I can’t beg myself. And in our condition
not to—is absolute ruin....”</p>

<p>“Why do you wander around?”</p>

<p>The stranger was silent as if it were hard for
him to answer this question.</p>

<p>“I’m looking for a shelter. In some monastery....
Since my youth I have been destined for the
monastic life.”</p>

<p>“You should live in a monastery.”</p>

<p>“I have a weakness,” said Ivan Ivanovich, almost
inaudibly and bashfully.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_39" id="Page_39">[39]</a></span></p>

<p>“You like drink.”</p>

<p>“Yes, that’s it. I was spoiled as a child.”</p>

<p>“Too bad!... The devil’s to blame for it.”</p>

<p>“Yes, the devil.... Of course.... Formerly,
when the people were serfs, <i>he</i> had a lot of work:
he wrestled with the monotonous life, we’ll say....
They all saw him.... And, just think, they struggled
just the same.... Now it’s our weakness....
The people are all inclined to it.”</p>

<p>“Y-yes,” assented Andrey Ivanovich. “It’s
much easier now for the impure.... He lives
with us, by heavens. Lie, dear, on the stove....
We’ll come to see you and bring one another....
Only entertain us.”</p>

<p>The stranger heaved a deep sigh.</p>

<p>“That is the truth!” he said sadly. “I’ll
tell you about myself,” he whispered, as if he
did not wish his words to be heard by any one in
the blackness along the road. “Do you know who
ruined me? My own mother and my father
superior!”</p>

<p>“Wh-what?” queried Andrey Ivanovich, also
in a low tone.</p>

<p>“Yes!... I know it’s sinful to blame my dead
mother,—may she rest in peace!” He took off his
hat and crossed himself. “And yet I keep thinking:
if she had had me taught a trade, I might<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_40" id="Page_40">[40]</a></span>
have been a man like the others.... No, she
wanted her child to have an easy life, the Lord
forgive her....”</p>

<p>“Go on, go on!” urged Andrey Ivanovich.</p>

<p>“You know,” continued Ivan Ivanovich sadly,
“in old times, as the books say, parents always
objected and children went secretly to the monastic
cell to devote themselves.... But my mother took
me herself to the monastery; she wanted me to
become a clerk.”</p>

<p>“Yes, yes!”</p>

<p>“And before that, I must tell you, they used
to make them psalmists and so on, ... but they
had changed by my time!”</p>

<p>“That’s the rank!”</p>

<p>“Yes!... And mother again! stay there in
the monastery.... That’s an easy life. And the
superior loves you.... That’s the truth: the
father superior did love me and took me as a
novice under his own charge. But if a man is
doomed, fortune will become misfortune. I’ll tell
you the truth: I fell because of an angel ... not
because of the devil....”</p>

<p>“What are you telling us?” said Andrey Ivanovich
in surprise.</p>

<p>“Just the truth.... Our superior was a wonderfully
kind soul, not evil, and strict.... But<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_41" id="Page_41">[41]</a></span>
he had a secret weakness; at times he’d drink.
Quietly, nobly. He’d shut himself up and drink
for three or four days. No more than that. Then
he’d all at once stop it.... He was a strong man....
But once, in that condition, he got bored.
And he called me and said: ‘Dear boy, mortify
yourself. Vanya, obey me and do something you
don’t want to. An innocent boy, stay with me,
a hardened sinner.’ Well, I did it, and sat and
listened how he talked with some one and wept
over that weakness of his.... I wasn’t strong,
and when I got tired I fell asleep. He said:
‘Vanya, take a drop to brace you up.’ And I
drank a glass of brandy.... ‘But swear to me,’
he said, ‘that you’ll never drink a drop alone without
me.’”</p>

<p>“So that’s it,” drawled Andrey Ivanovich
meaningly.</p>

<p>“Of course I swore. And he gave me another
glass.... And so it went. At first a little,
then—— The father superior was a strong man.
No matter how much he drank, he was still steady.
But, you know, after three or four glasses, my
feet went.... He remembered himself and forbade
me solemnly. It was too late. I didn’t
drink with him and I had the keys to the chest....
I began to take a nip secretly.... Another<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_42" id="Page_42">[42]</a></span>
and a larger one.... A second time I couldn’t
walk. He thought at first that it was from that
first drunkenness, because of my weakness. Then
he looked at me steadily and said: ‘Vanyushka,
do you want a glass?’ I trembled all over from
my longing for it. He guessed the truth. He
took his staff, caught it in my hair, and reasoned
with me.... He was strong and afraid of hurting
me.... It did no good. Again and again....
He saw that his weakness was ruining me. He
said to me: ‘Forgive me, Vanyushka, but you must
pass through temptation or you’ll be ruined....
Go and wander.... When you meet sorrow you
can be healed. I will pray for you. Come back
in a year,’ he said, ‘on this same date. I will receive
you like the prodigal son.’ He blessed me.
Began to weep. Called the rufalny, that is, the
monk who had charge of the habits, and ordered
him to get me ready to wander.... He himself
said the prayers for a brother who is going on a
journey.... And forth I went, the servant of the
Lord, on the twenty-ninth of August, the day of
the Beheading of St. John Baptist, for a period
of wandering....”</p>

<p>The narrator again stopped, drew his breath,
and coughed. Andrey Ivanovich sympathetically
stopped walking and the three of us stood in the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_43" id="Page_43">[43]</a></span>
dark road. Finally Ivan Ivanovich was rested
and we started on again....</p>

<p>“So I traveled summer and winter. It was hard
work and I had many sorrows. Yes! I went to
various monasteries. Some places I didn’t get
into the courtyard,—others I didn’t like. Our
monastery was supported by the state and rich and
I’d gotten accustomed to an easy life. And I
couldn’t get into another state monastery, but
they took me into one where all the monks lived
together, that of St. Cyril of Novoye Ozero, and it
was awful: we got little tea and not a bit of tobacco;
the monks were all peasants.... A hard
rule and a lot of work....”</p>

<p>“I bet you didn’t like that after your easy
life,” said Andrey Ivanovich.</p>

<p>“To tell the truth, I wasn’t strong enough,”
sighed Ivan Ivanovich humbly. “The burden was
too great.... And sanctity looked unpleasant in
that garb. There was no splendor.... A lot of
people and no choir.... They did make an awful
noise....”</p>

<p>“That’s sanctity!” said Andrey Ivanovich with
conviction.</p>

<p>“No, let me tell you,” answered Ivan Ivanovich
no less emphatically.... “You’re wrong....
That doesn’t determine the kind of monastery. A<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_44" id="Page_44">[44]</a></span>
monk must be trained and have a head like a
blade of grass ... and hold himself up.... That
makes a fine monk and there’s mighty few of them.
And the simple monk is smooth and clean with a
velvety voice. Benefactors and women go wild
over them. But a peasant, let me tell you, is no
account even there....”</p>

<p>“All right.... What next?” said Andrey Ivanovich,
a little surprised at the decided opinion of
the expert.</p>

<p>“What next?” answered the wanderer sadly.
“I wandered for a year. I fasted and wandered....
The worst was that my conscience bothered
me; I didn’t know how to beg. I waited and
waited for that year to end,—to go home, home,
to my poor cell. I thought of the father superior
as if he were my own father; I loved him so.
Finally August twenty-ninth came. I went into
the courtyard, you know, and somehow I felt badly.
Our attendants came to the gate.... They knew
me. ‘Wanderer Ivan, have you returned?’ ‘I
have,’ was my reply. ‘Is my benefactor alive?’
‘Too late,’ was the answer. ‘He was buried some
time ago. He was deemed worthy; he went away
with the collect of the Resurrection. He remembered
you ... and wept.... He wanted to reward
you.... We’ve got a new superior, ... a<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_45" id="Page_45">[45]</a></span>
barbarian. Don’t let him see you?’ But,” he
added, plaintively, “I can’t see Avtonomov.”</p>

<p>His voice betrayed his terror and sorrow.</p>

<h4>V</h4>

<p>Andrey Ivanovich stared into the darkness and
suddenly he caught hold of my hand, exclaiming:</p>

<p>“Stop! We shouldn’t have come.”</p>

<p>“What’s the matter?”</p>

<p>“I told the truth. Don’t chase on after them!
Wait for me.... I’ll run and see....”</p>

<p>He quickly disappeared in the darkness. I
stayed with Ivan Ivanovich in the road. When
the steps of the bootmaker died away, we heard
merely the quiet noises of the night. The grass
rustled gently; at times a rail whistled as it ran
nervously from place to place. In the vague distance
the frogs were croaking dreamily and playing
in the swamp. Hardly visible clouds were
rising.</p>

<p>“That’s just like him.... My comrade loves
to walk at night,” complained Ivan Ivanovich.
“What’s the use of it? Why not by day?”</p>

<p>“Was he in a monastery too?”</p>

<p>“Yes,” answered Ivan Ivanovich. Then, with
a sigh, “He’s from a good family. His father<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_46" id="Page_46">[46]</a></span>
was a deacon in the city of N. You may have
heard of him.... His brother is a secretary in a
police office. He was betrothed....”</p>

<p>“Why didn’t he marry?”</p>

<p>“Don’t you see, he’d already gone wrong....
He ran away ... but he wasn’t a wanderer yet.
He had the outfit but he didn’t wander.... He
passed as a suitor. He was accepted. The girl
loved him, and her father didn’t object.... Oh!...
Oh!... Of course, it was sinful, ... he deceived
them. Sometimes, when he tells about it,
you’ll cry, and then again it’s really funny.”</p>

<p>Ivan Ivanovich acted strangely. He laughed
and then began to choke and put his hand over
his mouth. At first you could hardly tell he was
laughing. But he really was,—an hysterical, bashful,
rather explosive laugh, which ended like a
cough. When he quieted down, Ivan Ivanovich
said, half-pityingly:</p>

<p>“Only he tells it different every time.... You
can’t tell whether it’s the truth or not.”</p>

<p>“He wouldn’t lie?”</p>

<p>“Not exactly, ... but he’s not always accurate.
You see, the truth——”</p>

<p>“Just what does he say?”</p>

<p>“You know, the clerk, he says, was clever. He
saw the young man wasting his time, really doing<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_47" id="Page_47">[47]</a></span>
nothing. He pretended to go to a bazaar,—so he
went to the city, left the old woman in the house,
and gave her strict orders to keep an eye on him.
Avtonomov, you see, didn’t live with them, but
in the village with the woman who baked the bread
for the church.... He kept visiting them....
Every day.... They’d sit by the river bank....
And the old woman was there, too. And, of course,
she watched them.... One time, my dear little
Avtonomov saw two men coming from the city in
a cart—and both drunk. They came up and
turned out to be the clerk and his older brother,
the secretary. He hadn’t even looked around—when
they landed on him and licked him. The
reason why: his brother, because he ran away from
the seminary; the clerk, for deceiving and disgracing
him....”</p>

<p>Ivan Ivanovich sighed.</p>

<p>“He hardly got off alive, he says.... They
were both angry and drunk.... He ran to the
house where he was living, grabbed his wallet, and
off into the woods.... Since then, he says, he’s
been wandering.... But, another time, he really
... tells something else.”</p>

<p>He came nearer to me and wanted to tell me
something very confidentially. But suddenly out
of the darkness near us came the figure of Andrey<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_48" id="Page_48">[48]</a></span>
Ivanovich. He walked rapidly with a deliberately
menacing scowl.</p>

<p>“Come here, if you please.” He took me aside
and whispered:</p>

<p>“You and I are in a nice mess!”</p>

<p>“How?”</p>

<p>“This Avtonomov, the monk, seems to have gone
off to steal.... We’ll get into trouble over him
yet....”</p>

<p>“That’s enough, Andrey Ivanovich.”</p>

<p>“Yes, for you. Did you hear what he asked in
the village? Of the soldier’s wife? About a certain
clerk? Is the clerk actually at home or not?”</p>

<p>“Yes, I remember.”</p>

<p>“Do you remember where that clerk lived?”</p>

<p>“Yes, by a cemetery.”</p>

<p>“There it is!” said Andrey Ivanovich maliciously,
pointing ahead in the darkness.</p>

<p>“What of it?”</p>

<p>“Just this.... The old woman, you heard, is
alone.... And he went right there.... He
walked around the yard and looked. You’ll see
for yourself.... That’s the sort of a fellow
you wanted to drop an old companion for.... If
he’d crossed the bridge without a board creaking,
we’d have gone straight along the road.... I
turned aside.... Let’s go ahead quietly.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_49" id="Page_49">[49]</a></span></p>

<p>Behind us some one coughed plaintively. Andrey
Ivanovich looked around and said:</p>

<p>“Come with us, novice.... What can we do
with you? You love your comrade.”</p>

<p>We crossed the bridge, followed the road and
came to the cemetery. On the hill a little light
shone through the trees. I saw the whitish walls
of a small house, perched on the edge of a hill,
and behind it was the dark outline of a bell-tower.
Below on the right it was easier to imagine than
to see the little stream.</p>

<p>“There he is,” said Andrey Ivanovich. “Do
you see him?”</p>

<p>Not far from us, between the wall and the
slope, near an arbor covered with foliage, was a
figure. A man seemed to be crowded against and
fastened to the fence and looking through the
bushes. By the light of the window, I saw the
pointed cap, the long neck, and the familiar profile
of Avtonomov. The light streamed out
through the trees and lilac blossoms. When I
went nearer, I saw in the window the head of
an old woman in a cap and with horn spectacles.
Her head nodded like that of a man who is working
when he is terribly sleepy, and the needles
moved rapidly in her hands. The old woman was
evidently waiting for her husband to return.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_50" id="Page_50">[50]</a></span></p>

<p>Suddenly she listened.... An irresolute call
came out of the darkness:</p>

<p>“Olimpiada Nikolayevna!”</p>

<p>The old woman looked out of the window but
saw no one.</p>

<p>A moment of silence, and then the same call was
repeated:</p>

<p>“Olimpiada Nikolayevna!”</p>

<p>I did not recognize Avtonomov’s voice. It
seemed soft and timid.</p>

<p>“Who’s there?” The old woman suddenly
started. “Who called me?”</p>

<p>“It’s I.... Don’t you remember Avtonomov?...
We used to know each other....”</p>

<p>“Avtonomov, mercy.... We never knew any
one of that name.... I don’t know you....
Wait a moment and I’ll call some one. Fedosya,
oh, Fedosya!... Come here quick....”</p>

<p>“Don’t call, mother.... I won’t disturb you....
Have you really forgotten Avtonomov?...
I used to be called Genasha....”</p>

<p>The old woman got up, took the candle and
held it out of the window. There was no breeze.
The flame burned steadily and illuminated the
bushes, the walls of the house, and the wrinkled
face of the old woman with her glasses pressed
up on her forehead.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_51" id="Page_51">[51]</a></span></p>

<p>“That voice sounded familiar.... Where are
you?... If you’re a good man——”</p>

<p>She held the candle above her head and the
light fell on Avtonomov. The old woman staggered,
but just then another woman entered the
room. The old woman grew bolder and again
threw the light on Avtonomov.</p>

<p>“Fine,” she said coldly. “The suitor, of course....
What are you walking around under the
window for?...”</p>

<p>“I happened to be passing, Olimpiada Nikolayevna——”</p>

<p>“Passing, and would pass.... See here, when
the master returns, he’ll set the dogs on you.”</p>

<p>She closed the window and lowered the curtain.
The bushes disappeared, and the figure of Avtonomov
was lost in the darkness.</p>

<p>We could then think of leaving, and we quickly
descended the hillock.... In a few minutes we
heard the bells in the tower. Some one apparently
wanted to show that there were people in the
cemetery....</p>

<p>Andrey Ivanovich walked slowly and thoughtfully.
Ivan Ivanovich ran panting at a dog trot
and constantly stifling his cough.... When we
had reached a proper distance he stopped and said
again with indescribable sorrow:</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_52" id="Page_52">[52]</a></span></p>

<p>“We’ve lost Avtonomov....”</p>

<p>His voice was so despairing that Andrey Ivanovich
and I involuntarily felt sorry for him. We
stopped and began to peer into the darkness.</p>

<p>“He’s coming,” said Andrey Ivanovich, straining
his lynx-like eyes.</p>

<p>In very truth we soon saw behind us a strange
shape like a moving tree. Avtonomov had large
bunches of lilacs in his belt, on his shoulders, and
in his hands, and even his cap was decorated with
flowers. When he caught up with us he had perfect
control of himself and seemed neither glad
nor astonished. He walked on along the road and
the branches waved about him in a very peculiar
manner.</p>

<p>“It’s great to walk at night, signor,” he began
grandiloquently, like an actor. “The fields are
clothed in darkness.... There’s a grove on one
side.... See how peaceful it is! The nightingale
pours forth its melody....”</p>

<p>He almost declaimed this but yet his voice
showed that he was a little exasperated.</p>

<p>“Wouldn’t you like a spray from my garden,
signor?”</p>

<p>With a theatrical gesture, he offered me a branch
of lilacs.</p>

<p>Near the road a nightingale sang timidly and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_53" id="Page_53">[53]</a></span>
irresolutely. In the distance, in answer to the
bells from the cemetery, came another, and we
could hear the noise of a rattle. Somewhere
on the dark plain dogs were barking....
The night grew darker and it began to feel like
rain....</p>

<p>“I’m sorry,” Avtonomov suddenly began at random,
“I got separated from you by the cemetery.
I have an old friend who lives there, a real old
friend. If he’d been home, we’d all have gotten
lodging and something to eat.... The old woman
asked me to stop, ... but without her husband——”</p>

<p>Ivan Ivanovich cleared his throat. The bootmaker
snorted ironically.</p>

<p>Avtonomov must have guessed that we had seen
more than he thought, for he turned to me and
said:</p>

<p>“Judge not, signor, that ye be not judged....
Another’s soul, signor, is dark.... Some time,”
he added resolutely, “believe me, I’ll come here,
... and I’ll be entertained.... And then....”</p>

<p>“And then?”</p>

<p>“Oh!... we’ll be entertained.... Drink till
you can’t see.... And I’ll crow over it....”</p>

<p>“Why?”</p>

<p>“Why! This place should be like any other.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_54" id="Page_54">[54]</a></span>
But yet, signor, it appeals to me.... The
past....”</p>

<p>He walked on more rapidly.</p>

<p>We passed by a little village and reached the
last hut. Its small windows looked out sightlessly
into the dark field.... All were sleeping within.</p>

<p>Avtonomov suddenly walked up to the window
and tapped sharply on the pane. An indistinct
face appeared behind it.</p>

<p>“Who’s there?” asked a dull voice, and a frightened
face was pressed against the glass. “Who’s
coming around this time of night?”</p>

<p>“The d-devil,” drawled Avtonomov in a piercing,
evil tone, and he stuck his head with its floral
decorations against the pane.... The face within
disappeared in terror.... Dogs began to bark in
the village; the guard struck his rattle; the dark
plain went on guard.... Again somewhere in the
distance the sleeping churches droned forth their
prolonged notes, as if to defend the peaceful region
from some unknown evil. As if they felt that
above them was hanging the menace of certain
dark and hopelessly ruined lives.</p>

<h4>VI</h4>

<p>We walked for more than an hour through the
dark fields. Weariness claimed its own and we<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_55" id="Page_55">[55]</a></span>
neither wished to speak nor listen. At first I kept
on thinking and tried in the darkness to imagine
the appearance of my companions. This worked
with Andrey Ivanovich, whom I knew well, and
also with the little wanderer, but I had forgotten
the features of Avtonomov, and as I looked at his
dark form I could not recall his face.... Avtonomov
at the clerk’s house and yesterday’s preacher
seemed two distinct people.</p>

<p>My thoughts became still more confused; several
days of tramping,—the dull night, the silence,
the heavy, muddy road or the absence of one,—this
was all that I could learn from my great
weariness, and I began to lose myself as I walked
along. It was a sort of semi-consciousness which
permitted fantastic dreams strangely intertwined
with reality. But reality for me was merely the
dark road and three misty shapes, now behind me,
now driving me onward.... I went with them
almost unconsciously.</p>

<p>When I partially awoke, they were standing in
the road and arguing.</p>

<p>“Open your eyes,” said the bootmaker, angrily
but lazily.</p>

<p>“Thanks for your explanation,—I wouldn’t
have guessed it,” answered the wanderer. “Don’t
you know, signor, how to get to the road?”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_56" id="Page_56">[56]</a></span></p>

<p>I looked out lazily into the darkness. With its
arms disappearing among the clouds, a huge black
windmill towered above us; behind and beside it
were others. I thought the whole field was dotted
with windmills, silent but menacing....</p>

<p>“I’ve been spitting all night to beat this devil,”
said Andrey Ivanovich venomously.</p>

<p>“Well, just keep still a little while, lanky
signor,” said Avtonomov. “Listen!...”</p>

<p>“Grinding?” said Andrey Ivanovich questioningly....</p>

<p>“Right,” answered Avtonomov cheerfully.
“The wheels are working. What a jolly little
river!”</p>

<p>“Is it far?”</p>

<p>“Yes, by the road. We’ll take a short cut.”</p>

<p>“You’ll land us in the swamp, you devil....”</p>

<p>My feet carried me through the darkness after
the three dark figures. I stumbled over the stubble
or the hummocks, and they threw me forward or
to the side.... If I had met a ravine or a river,—I
would probably have waked up at the bottom....
At times strange phantoms leaped and flew from
my head into the unshapen fog.</p>

<p>Finally I ceased to stumble over hummocks. I
felt a level road beneath my feet and I heard an
even, kindly hum. Water was pouring, roaring,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_57" id="Page_57">[57]</a></span>
running, splashing and foaming, telling of something
interesting, but too confused.... The noise
stopped, but suddenly it became louder, as if the
water were pouring through a dam.... I woke up
completely and looked around in surprise....
Andrey Ivanovich caught me from behind. He
took my arm and pushed me ahead....</p>

<p>“Wake up ... you’ll sleep when you’re walking....
We’re tied up with the devil and may
God forgive us!... If the peasants come out,
they’ll break our necks.... Quick, quick....
See Ivan Ivanovich go with his cassock held
up....”</p>

<p>Indeed, the little wanderer was running with a
speed that surprised me.</p>

<p>“Here ... here....”</p>

<p>Without understanding what had happened, I
found myself hidden in the thick willows on the
bank of a little stream. Ivan Ivanovich was panting....
Avtonomov was not with us. Near by
the mill was roaring. The water raged and poured
through the open sluices. One wheel was turning
heavily as before,—another seemed locked,—it
trembled and groaned beneath the assaults of the
water. A dog was pulling at his chain and howling
with anger.</p>

<p>A window in the mill lighted up as if the building<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_58" id="Page_58">[58]</a></span>
had waked and opened one eye. A door creaked and
the old miller in a white shirt and trousers came
out on the platform with a lantern. Behind him
came another man, yawning and stretching.</p>

<p>“Did the dam go out?” he asked.</p>

<p>“It certainly did,—hear it roar in the sluice-ways;
it almost broke the bars.... Just look....
Oh, ye saints....”</p>

<p>“Just look; they’re open.”</p>

<p>“What the devil! Who opened them?”</p>

<p>The peasants went to the sluices. The roar soon
died away; they pushed both bolts and the mill
stopped. The light of the lantern slowly crawled
back along the dam and again disappeared. Then
a rattle sounded shrilly. One peasant was evidently
still on guard....</p>

<p>The unusual commotion at the mill, sounding
across the fields, again roused the sleeping villages.
It was surprising how many of them were hidden
in the darkness. From all sides, in front, behind,
almost beneath, they answered the alarm with the
beating of boards and rattles. The slow peal of a
bell floated up from a distant village or a cemetery.
Near by some night bird called.</p>

<p>“Let’s go,” said Andrey Ivanovich, when the
mill had become quiet.... “One rascal can so
disturb people.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_59" id="Page_59">[59]</a></span></p>

<p>“What’s the matter?” I asked.</p>

<p>“Ask him,” said the bootmaker spitefully, and
he pointed to Ivan Ivanovich.</p>

<p>“Y-yes,” answered the wanderer sadly. “Of
course, it’s outrageous.... I don’t approve of
it....”</p>

<p>“What’s the matter? Where’s Avtonomov?”</p>

<p>“There he is—calling like a bird and making
signs to us.... Come here, my dear companions....
How the rascal managed to open the
sluices, I didn’t happen to notice. You, too!...
You’ll follow him and sleep. If you’d kept on ...
and the peasants had appeared before,—there’d
have been a picnic. You bet! I’ll catch that devil
and don’t you interfere. I’ll turn him inside out
and run his feet out through his throat!...”</p>

<p>He started ahead with his mind made up.</p>

<h4>VII</h4>

<p>Andrey Ivanovich did not carry out his savage
intentions and in a half hour we were
again walking silently along the road.... It was
not yet sunrise, but the white, milky streaks kept
breaking through the clouds, and beneath our feet
we could see the whitish fog which covered the
whole plain. Suddenly the fog opened and showed<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_60" id="Page_60">[60]</a></span>
us a horse’s head and a cart loaded with sacks and
a peasant sleeping on them and another empty cart
behind it.</p>

<p>“Uncle, hey, uncle,” said Andrey Ivanovich to
the second peasant, “won’t you take us along?”</p>

<p>The peasant rubbed his sleepy eyes and looked
with amazement at the crowd which had surrounded
him.</p>

<p>“Where did God bring you from?”</p>

<p>“A pilgrimage.”</p>

<p>“So, so! Sit down, but I can’t take you far;
we’re from around here.”</p>

<p>“You’re not from the mill?”</p>

<p>“They were at the mill, but I’m empty. Sit
down; that’s right.”</p>

<p>We got into the cart and sat down, letting our
feet hang.</p>

<p>“Let me ask you a question,” said our guide,
clucking to his horse; “have you been walking all
night?”</p>

<p>“Yes.”</p>

<p>“You didn’t hear anything, did you?”</p>

<p>“Some dogs barking in the distance. Why?”</p>

<p>“Why? Some one opened the sluices in the mill
and almost smashed the wheels.”</p>

<p>“Who was it?”</p>

<p>“I don’t know! Some one got fooling around at<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_61" id="Page_61">[61]</a></span>
night. In our little village near by, they say, the
fellow asked to be taken in. A peasant looked out,
but he said: ‘I’m the devil, let me in.’”</p>

<p>“He was,” said Avtonomov, who had discarded
his decorations some time before.</p>

<p>“He wasn’t.... I’ll never believe it.... And
I won’t let you either.” Andrey Ivanovich spoke
ardently and decidedly to the peasant. “Some
rascals have been deceiving you country people....
Your simplicity....”</p>

<p>“There are people who do not believe in God and
the Saints,” said Avtonomov, with the greatest
humility and composure.</p>

<p>Andrey Ivanovich gritted his teeth and showed
Avtonomov his fist, when the peasant was not looking.</p>

<h4>VIII</h4>

<p>About noon we reached my home in the same
kind of a cart. This we had happened to meet at
the edge of the city. The cart stopped at the gate.
Our picturesque company attracted the attention
of several passers-by, a thing that clearly annoyed
Andrey Ivanovich.... I asked my companion to
come in and rest and have some tea.</p>

<p>“Thanks, I haven’t far to go,” answered the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_62" id="Page_62">[62]</a></span>
bootmaker coldly. He threw his wallet on his back
and, then, without ceremony, he pointed at Avtonomov.</p>

<p>“Are you inviting him in?”</p>

<p>“Yes, I’m inviting Gennady Sergeyevich,” I
answered.</p>

<p>Andrey Ivanovich turned sharply and, without
saying good-bye, he started down the street.</p>

<p>Ivan Ivanovich looked desperately frightened,
as if my invitation had caught him in a trap. He
looked appealingly at Avtonomov, and shame at
being present tortured his whole figure. Avtonomov
asked simply:</p>

<p>“Where are we going?”</p>

<p>While the samovar was being heated, I asked the
servants to gather up some superfluous clothes and
linen and offered my companions a change of
attire. Avtonomov at once consented, tied them
all in one bundle and said:</p>

<p>“We’ve got to have a bath....”</p>

<p>Of course, I did not object. Both wanderers
came back from the bath transformed. Ivan Ivanovich,
in a coat which was too broad and trousers
which were too long and with his thin hair, looked
astonishingly like a woman in man’s clothes. As far
as Avtonomov was concerned, he was not satisfied
with the conventional amount of clothing, but he<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_63" id="Page_63">[63]</a></span>
had put on everything which had been given him
to choose from. He was wearing, consequently, a
blue shirt, a blouse, two vests, and a coat. The
shirt stuck up above the collar of the blouse and
reached below it,—it was so much longer. The
edge of the blouse was visible and the coat seemed
to form a third layer.... At the tea table Ivan
Ivanovich was so miserable that we let him take
his cup into the kitchen, where he sat down in one
corner and immediately won the sympathy of our
cook.</p>

<p>Avtonomov acted recklessly, called my mother
signora and jumped up every minute in order to
serve something.</p>

<p>After tea he looked himself over from head to
foot and said, with an air of satisfaction:</p>

<p>“In this costume my brother-in-law won’t be
ashamed of me.... I’ll go see my sister.... She
lives near here. May I leave my wallet in your
hall, signora?”</p>

<p>When he went to the gate, Ivan Ivanovich ran
after him in terror. After a short conversation
Avtonomov permitted the poor fellow to follow him
at some distance.</p>

<p>Ivan Ivanovich soon returned alone. His bird-like
face beamed with surprise and delight.</p>

<p>“They received him,” he said, clearing his throat<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_64" id="Page_64">[64]</a></span>
joyfully. “That’s the solemn truth. He really
has a sister. And a brother-in-law.... Please go
past, accidentally.... You’ll see it, too.... As
God is true, they’re sitting in a garden entertaining
him ... like a brother. His sister’s weeping
from joy....”</p>

<p>From the breast of the little wanderer came
strange sounds like hysterical laughing and weeping.</p>

<p>In an hour Avtonomov appeared, transfigured
and triumphant. He came up to me, fervently
grasped my hand, and pressed it till it hurt.</p>

<p>“Through you I’ve found my relatives....
Yes.... That’s it! Till death....”</p>

<p>He pressed my hand still harder, then convulsively
released it and turned away. Apparently
the brother-in-law, who was not without influence
in the consistory, believed in Avtonomov’s reformation
and decided to help him. It was also necessary
to get certain papers from Uglich and....</p>

<p>“Back here again! My wanderings are ended,
signor.... I won’t forsake you, Vanya.... I’ll
give you a corner and food.... Live.... I’ll be
responsible.... You’ll get quarters ... also....”</p>

<p>As I listened to this conversation, involuntary
doubts crept into my mind, the more so as Avtonomov
had resumed his grandiloquent manner and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_65" id="Page_65">[65]</a></span>
kept using more and more frequently the word
signor....</p>

<p>Towards evening the two set out “for Uglich to
get the papers.” Avtonomov gave me a solemn
promise to return in a week “to begin his new
life.”</p>

<p>“Is this all that was necessary for this ‘miracle?’”
I thought doubtfully....</p>

<h4>IX</h4>

<p>The weather suddenly changed.... A wonderful
early spring seemed to be replaced by
late, cold autumn.... It rained hard for days
and the wind howled amid the rain and the fog.</p>

<p>One cold morning of this kind I awoke late and
was trying to guess the time when I heard a light
noise and a strange whistle in the hall by the door.
I opened and saw some living creature in a dark
corner. Yes! it was Ivan Ivanovich. He trembled
all over, was blue, and looked at me with his appealing,
timid eyes. It was the look of a frightened
animal near its end.</p>

<p>“Your weakness again?” I asked kindly.</p>

<p>“Yes,” he answered humbly and briefly, and he
started to straighten his clothing. He was again
wearing an impossible cassock, he had no hat, and
on his bare feet were rough shoes.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_66" id="Page_66">[66]</a></span></p>

<p>Avtonomov soon made his appearance. He was
drunk and unpleasantly bold. He spoke in affectedly
grandiloquent phrases, acted like an old
friend, and from time to time in his reminiscences
of our wanderings he made spicy allusions to a
certain soldier’s wife.... In his eyes gleamed an
evil passion and in him I recognized again the
preacher in the monastery courtyard,—and readiness
for any evil deed. He never said a word about
his visit to his sister....</p>

<p>“Listen ... Dearie, ...” he turned to the
maid.... “The other time I left a cassock with
you.... It’s still fit to be worn.... Your present
was unlucky,” he added, looking impudently
at me.... “We were robbed near Uglich ...
and they took absolutely everything we had. A
merchant cheated you on those felt shoes, that’s
easy to see.... Cheap goods, cheap.... They
fell all to pieces....”</p>

<p>He condescendingly patted my shoulder.</p>

<p>Ivan Ivanovich looked at his protector reproachfully.
We parted quite coldly, but everyone in my
house felt sincere sympathy and pity for Ivan Ivanovich.</p>

<p>After that, from time to time, I heard from my
accidental comrades. These messages were usually
brought by people in cloaks and cassocks and with<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_67" id="Page_67">[67]</a></span>
more or less clear indications of “weakness” they
gave me greetings or notes and they showed how
disillusioned they felt, when they saw the meagreness
of the reward which they received. Once during
the fair a fellow appeared totally drunk and
very evil looking, but he handed me a note with as
much mysterious familiarity as if it had been from
a mutual friend and confidant.</p>

<p>In the note a very shaky and uneven hand had
scribbled:</p>

<p>“Dear friend. Receive the bearer as you would
me. He is our friend and can tell you everything;
incidentally give him money and clothing....
His trousers are pretty bad.... Gennady Avtonomov.”</p>

<p>One glance was enough to show that the agent
was really in dire need of trousers.... But in
spite of his intoxication, his eyes quickly
and curiously ran over the contents of my rooms, and they
showed well the results of professional training....</p>

<p>When he left, I heard an unpleasant noise and
I had to run to the assistance of my good neighbors.</p>

<h4>X</h4>

<p>About two years passed, before I again met my
former companions.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_68" id="Page_68">[68]</a></span></p>

<p>One hot summer’s day, I had crossed the Volga
on a ferry and a pair of horses was dragging us
over the sands of the bank to the foot of a hill.
The sun had set, but it was intolerably hot. It
seemed as if whole waves of heat were being wafted
from the gleaming river. Flies hung in clouds over
the horses, the bells rang unevenly, and the wheels
dragged in the deep sand.... Half way up the
hill a monastery nestled among the trees and
as it looked down on the river out of the rising mist,
it seemed to be suspended in midair.</p>

<p>Suddenly the coachman stopped his weary team
at the very foot of the hill and ran along the bank.
A quarter of a verst away on the rocky and pebbly
edge of the river was a black group of people directly
between us and the sun.</p>

<p>“Something’s happened,” said my companion.</p>

<p>I got out and also walked up to the place.</p>

<p>A dead body was lying on the bare bank, against
which the water was splashing lazily. When I
came nearer, I recognized in it my old acquaintance:
the little wanderer was lying in his cassock,
on his stomach, with outstretched hands and with
his head turned at an unnatural angle. He was
pale as death; his black hair had fallen over his
forehead and temples, and his mouth was half
open. I involuntarily recalled that face, as it was<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_69" id="Page_69">[69]</a></span>
when it was filled with childish delight over the
singing of the little bird on the hilltop. With his
long, sharp nose and his open mouth,—he reminded
me greatly of a tortured and stifled bird.</p>

<p>Avtonomov sat swaying back and forth beside
him and seemed frightened. There was a perceptible
odor of wine in the air....</p>

<p>Glancing at the people who were coming up and
not recognizing me, he suddenly pulled the dead
body.</p>

<p>“Get up, comrade, it’s time to be going.... A
wanderer’s fate is to wander always.”</p>

<p>He spoke in a very bombastic manner, but he
rose uncertainly....</p>

<p>“Don’t you want to? Look, Vanya, I’ll leave
you! I’ll go off alone....”</p>

<p>A village chief, with a medal on his chest, hurried
up to the group and laid one hand on Avtonomov’s
shoulder.</p>

<p>“Stop, don’t go away.... You’ve got to make
a statement.... What sort of people are you?”</p>

<p>Avtonomov, with ironical humility, took off his
cap and bowed.</p>

<p>“Please be so kind, your village excellency....”</p>

<p>Above our heads sounded a peal of the bell. The
monks were being summoned to vespers. The peal
echoed, disturbed the heated air, and rolled above<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_70" id="Page_70">[70]</a></span>
the leafy tops of the oaks and black poplars beside
the monastery and as it died away, it fell to the
sleepy river. The sound increased again, as it
struck the water, and a keen eye could almost follow
its flight to the other bank, to the bluish, mist-wrapped
meadows.</p>

<p>All removed their hats. Avtonomov turned toward
the sound and shook his fist in the air.</p>

<p>“Listen, Vanya,” he said, “your father superior
is calling you.... Your benefactor.... Now
he’ll receive you, I know....”</p>

<p>Peal after peal, rapid and repeated, ringing and
quavering, fell down upon the river solemnly and
quietly....</p>

<h3>ISN’T IT TERRIBLE?</h3>

<p class="center">(FROM THE DIARY OF A REPORTER)</p>

<h4>I</h4>

<p class="dropcap">“Be in N-sk on the twentieth. Session of district
court. Details in letter. Editor.”</p>

<p>I looked at my watch and then went to inquire
about the trains. I hoped that I could not catch
the night train at the station, which was some ten
versts from the city where I had just finished another
piece of reporting. I saw already the laconic
and business-like answer: “Telegram delayed,
cannot arrive on twentieth.” Unfortunately the
time-table and my watch decided differently. I
had three hours to pack and get to the station.
That was time enough.</p>

<p>About 11 o’clock on a warm summer evening a
coachman landed me at the station; the lights could
be seen for a great distance. I got there just in
time; the train was waiting.</p>

<p>Directly opposite the entrance there was a car
with the windows open. It was not filled and some
intelligent-appearing men were playing cards. I<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_74" id="Page_74">[74]</a></span>
imagined that they were members of the court going
to the session, and I decided to look for a place
elsewhere. This was no easy task but I finally
succeeded. The train was just starting when, with
my bag in my hand, I entered a second-class compartment
in which there were three passengers.</p>

<p>I sat down by the window, through which entered
the freshness of the summer night, and soon there
were flying past me ends of sleepers, hills, roaring
bridges, buildings, fields bathed in the moonlight,—all
as if carried by a high wind. I was tired
and sad. I thought how my life was flying in the
same way, from bridge to bridge, from station to
station, from city to city, from fire to law court....
And that I could never write for any paper
what the editor wanted. And all that I would
write the next day would be dry and uninteresting.</p>

<p>These were not cheerful thoughts. I tore myself
away from them and began to listen to the conversation
of my fellow travelers.</p>

<h4>II</h4>

<p>My nearest neighbor was sleeping contentedly,
letting me stretch out as I could. Opposite me one
passenger was lying down and another was sitting
by the window. They kept on with the conversation
they had already commenced.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_75" id="Page_75">[75]</a></span></p>

<p>“Let’s imagine,” said the one who was lying
down, “that I am a man who is not superstitious....
But yet” (he yawned pleasantly and slowly)
“it cannot be denied that there is much, so to
speak, unknown,—isn’t that so?... Let’s suppose,
the peasants ... country naïvete and superstition.
But take a paper....”</p>

<p>“Well, a paper. Superstition is for peasants,
but this is for the papers. A peasant, simple fellow,
sees a primitive devil with horns and breathing
fire. He’s frightened.... A reporter sees a
figure from the ballet....”</p>

<p>The gentleman who admitted that there was
“much unknown” yawned again.</p>

<p>“Yes,” he said with a somewhat scientific air,
“that is true; fears disappear with the development
of culture and education....”</p>

<p>His companion did not reply, but later said
thoughtfully:</p>

<p>“Disappear?... Do you remember in Tolstoy:
Anna Karenina and Vronsky have the identical
dream: a peasant, an ordinary laborer ‘works in
steel’ and speaks French.... Both wake up in
terror.... What’s so terrible there? Of course,
it’s a little strange for a peasant to speak French.
But, granted.... Nevertheless, in a given combination
of circumstances, a picture which is not<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_76" id="Page_76">[76]</a></span>
frightful will terrify you.... Take the Brothers
Karamazov of Dostoyevsky.... We’ve got there
an urban devil.... You remember, of course....”</p>

<p>“No, I don’t.... You know, Pavel Semenovich,
I’m an instructor of mathematics....”</p>

<p>“Oh, excuse me.... I thought.... Yes, I remember:
he was a certain man, or, better yet, a
certain type of Russian gentleman, quite well along
in years, with his hair and pointed beard rather
gray.... His linen and necktie, you know, were
like those of any other stylish gentleman, but his
linen was rather dirty and his necktie frayed.
To sum up, ‘He looked like a man of taste with
slender financial resources....’”</p>

<p>“That’s a fine devil! A mere sharper, and
they’re common enough,” remarked the mathematician.</p>

<p>“Yes, I know there’s a lot of them.... But
it’s frightful and it’s that, just because it’s so
common; that same poor necktie, linen, and coat....
If it were only frayed, it would be like yours
or mine....”</p>

<p>“All right, Pavel Semenovich.... Excuse me,
but you have a strange philosophy.”</p>

<p>The mathematician seemed rather insulted.
Pavel Semenovich turned towards the light, and I
had a good view of his broad face, straight brows<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_77" id="Page_77">[77]</a></span>
and gray, thoughtful eyes hidden under his stern
forehead.</p>

<p>Both paused. For a little while you could
hear only the hurried roar of the train. Then
Pavel Semenovich began again in his even
voice.</p>

<p>“At the station of N-sk I happened, you know,
to walk up toward the engine. I’m a little acquainted
with the engineer.... A chronically
sleepy individual with swollen eyes.”</p>

<p>“Yes?” asked his companion indifferently, and
not trying to conceal his feelings.</p>

<p>“Certainly.... A natural condition. He hadn’t
slept for thirty-six hours.”</p>

<p>“M-n, yes.... That is a long while.”</p>

<p>“I thought so too: we fall asleep.... The train
is flying at full speed.... And it’s run by a man
who is almost stupefied....”</p>

<p>His companion fidgeted a little.</p>

<p>“What an idea!... Really, damnation....
You should have told the chief of the station....”</p>

<p>“What for?... He’d laugh! A common thing.
You might almost call it the system. In Petersburg
there’s a gentleman sitting in some office....
He’s got a board in front of him with numbers
on it. Arrival.... Departure.... And the
engineers are listed too.... Pay—so much.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_78" id="Page_78">[78]</a></span>
Versts—so many. Versts—that’s the length of
the run,—a useful number, profitable, steady, that
can be increased. The pay for the men is minus....
And this fellow just cracks his head, thinking
how to run the largest number of miles on the
smallest number of engineers. Or even make the
distance larger than ever.... It’s a sort of silent
game with numbers, so to speak.... And a most
ordinary chap bothers with it.... He wears a
poor coat and necktie, and he looks respectable....
A good friend and a fine husband.... He
loves his child and gives presents to his wife on
holidays.... His job is harmless, and he merely
decides simple questions. The result is that sleep
kills people.... And across the fields and through
the ravines of our beloved country on such moonlight
nights as this trains tear along like this, and
the watch is kept by the sleepy, swollen eyes of
the man who is responsible for hundreds of lives....
A moment’s slumber....”</p>

<p>The legs of the mathematician in their checkered
trousers stirred: he got up from his seat in
the shadow and sat down on a bench.... His fat,
expressionless face, with its thick, clipped mustache,
made you uneasy.</p>

<p>“Stop your croaking, for heaven’s sake,” he
said angrily. “However you argue, the result is<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_79" id="Page_79">[79]</a></span>
the same, devil take it.... I wanted to fall
asleep....”</p>

<p>Pavel Semenovich looked at him in surprise.</p>

<p>“What’s the matter?” he said. “Are you crazy?
We’ll get there all right, if God wills. I merely
want to point out how the terrible and the usual
are combined.... Economy is the most ordinary
idea of life.... But sometimes it involves death....
It is even measurable by the law of probability....”</p>

<p>The mathematician, still more angry, took out
his cigar case and said, as he began to smoke:</p>

<p>“No, you’re right: the devil knows: the rascal’ll
fall asleep, and all at once.... These beasts of
railroad men.... O, let’s talk of something else.
The devil take these fears.... Are you still vegetating
in Tikhodol?... You’ve stuck there a
long time....”</p>

<p>“Yes,” answered Pavel Semenovich, a little embarrassed.
“It’s such a wretched place. It’s just
like living in a yoke.... A teacher, prosecutor,
excise official.... When you once land there,
you’re forgotten, and removed from the lists of
the living....”</p>

<p>“Yes.... It is an awful place.... It’s deadening....
Why, there’s not even a club there.
And the mud is unendurable.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_80" id="Page_80">[80]</a></span></p>

<p>“There’s a club now, at least that’s what we
call it.... And there are a few stretches of pavement....
Lighting, especially in the centre of the
town.... But, I’ll confess, I live on the edge,
and don’t make much use of these conveniences.”</p>

<p>“Where do you live?”</p>

<p>“With Budnikov, in the suburbs.”</p>

<p>“Budnikov? Semen Nikolayevich? Just think,
I lived in that section myself: with Father Polidorov....
Of course, I met Budnikov! A fine
man, well educated, but rather—filled with ideas?”</p>

<p>“Yes, with a few notions....”</p>

<p>“No, not that.... I said ideas. But notions.
What? None special, I think.”</p>

<p>“No, nothing special, but just the same: he used
to keep valuable papers in a mattress....”</p>

<p>“Why, I never knew that. But when I met
him he made a queer impression on me. He was
so fresh and original.... A house owner, and all
of a sudden he went to living in two rooms without
servants.... No, I remember, he had a kind of
porter....”</p>

<p>“Yes, Gavrilo....”</p>

<p>“That’s right, that’s right. Gavrilo, a little
fellow with white eyebrows? Yes? That’s right....
I remember I liked to look at his face: such
a good-natured snout. I almost thought the master<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_81" id="Page_81">[81]</a></span>
was part workman.... Who is he? Is he always
that way?”</p>

<p>Pavel Semenovich said nothing for a few minutes.
He then looked at his companion with some
embarrassment and replied:</p>

<p>“Y-yes, you’re right.... That actually happened....
Semen Nikolayevich ... and Gavrilo....
Both together....”</p>

<p>“Yes, I remember....”</p>

<p>“He was a fine man for our city.... Educated,
independent, with ideas.... He went to the university
but never finished because of some escapade....
He once spoke of it as if he had made an
unfortunate venture into love. ‘My heart was
broken,’ he said. On the other hand I know that
he corresponded with a friend in some outlandish
place. That shows there was something behind it....
His father, he said, was a usurer, but not a
malicious one. This caused a row between father
and son. The young student didn’t approve of
it and wouldn’t touch the money, but lived by
teaching.... When the father died, Semen
Nikolayevich came and inherited the property. He
said to some one: ‘I don’t want it.... This is
owed to society.’ Then I don’t know what happened....
The house, land, long-term leases, a
lawsuit.... He carried it on one, two, three years,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_82" id="Page_82">[82]</a></span>
and then got to like it. Many still remember how
he said: ‘I’ll finish the lawsuit with these curs and
settle up.... I won’t stay a day longer in this
confounded hole.’ ... But it’s the usual story....
We had a teacher once, a zoölogist, who came
to our gymnasium and said bluntly: ‘As soon as
I write my dissertation, I’ll get out of the
swamp!’”</p>

<p>“That’s Kallistov, isn’t it?” asked the mathematician,
with great interest. The narrator waved
assent.</p>

<p>“He’s still writing it. He married; had three
children.... That’s just the way with Semen
Nikolayevich Budnikov. He’s been making a dissertation
of his life, so to speak. He began to
enjoy this lawsuit. Challenges, protests, cassation,
the whole game.... And he kept writing himself
without consulting lawyers.... Then, after a while,
he commenced to build a new house. When I got to
know him, he was already a lucky, middle-aged
bachelor, with a reddish face, and such a pleasant,
quiet, substantial and sleepy voice. Then he had
a few peculiarities. He sometimes used to come
to see me, especially when it was time to pay my
rent.... This was due on the twentieth. That
meant that on the twentieth he used to come at
eight o’clock in the evening and drink two cups<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_83" id="Page_83">[83]</a></span>
of tea with rum in it. No more, no less! In each
cup two spoonfuls of rum and one of sugar. I got
to look at this as an addition to my rent. He
did the same with all his lodgers,—only some with
and some without rum. The rents were all different,
about twenty in his four houses (one in the city
was quite large).... That made forty cups of
tea.... He seemed as if he had included that in
his budget and marked it down.... Sometimes,
‘I didn’t find so and so at home, but he brought
the money the next day. Still owing, two cups
of tea.’”</p>

<p>“Really?” laughed Petr Petrovich. “He never
reasoned that way! Why do you think so?”</p>

<p>“For this reason. At first this was an unexpected
characteristic, but it got to be believed,
although in your time maybe it didn’t exist. The
tenants began to say: you know M. Budnikov is
an economical man. That was meant well and
even as a sign of approval. But it suddenly
reacted on Budnikov.... You understand? The
unintelligible man began to develop a special intelligible
trait.... It became clearer and clearer.
All believed, for example, that M. Budnikov kept
no servants. Gavrilo was the porter of the house
where I lived; he used to clean the clothes of the
different people, fix the samovars, and run errands.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_84" id="Page_84">[84]</a></span>
Sometimes the master and servant used to sit side
by side and clean shoes, the porter for the tenants,
Budnikov for himself. Then M. Budnikov got a
horse. No special need for him to do it. As a
luxury, he’d ride twice a week to a farm near the
city. The rest of the time the horse was free.
Gavrilo wasn’t busy all the time either.... The
result was—the horse was put at Gavrilo’s disposal,
and he used to ride down town. Gavrilo had nothing
against this arrangement, because he considered
incessant work his special duty. You know there’s
a sort of talent for everything, and I thought once
that Gavrilo was a kind of genius in the field of
muscular labor.... Easy motioned,—unwearied
freshness. Sometimes at night he wouldn’t sleep.
Look out of the window and you’d see Gavrilo
sweeping the street or cleaning the ditches. It
meant—he’d gone to bed and then remembered he
hadn’t swept all the pavement the last thing. So
he’d go and clean it. And this was really beautiful.”</p>

<p>“Yes,” said the mathematician, “that’s a good
description of the man. I remember I liked to
look at him,—he seemed rather attractive.”</p>

<p>“Spiritual poise is always beautiful, and he did
his duty without speculating about his relation to
his master.... And that was a fine thing, you<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_85" id="Page_85">[85]</a></span>
know,—their mutual relations. One used his
muscles admirably. The other gave reason and
rational meaning to it.... He saw that the time
was not all filled ... and he found a new occupation....
There was a sort of balancing of
interests, almost an idyl.... Almost before
dawn Gavrilo was at work. M. Budnikov also got
up early. They said good morning with a manifestly
pleasant feeling. Then M. Budnikov either
went to work in his garden or went around his
‘estate’ scattered through the city. Poverty gets
up early, and he went mornings to poverty’s quarters....
Then he’d come back and say:</p>

<p>“‘Now harness up, Gavrilo, and I’ll finish cleaning
up.... The officials are just going to their
offices. You may meet some one....’</p>

<p>“At this time he considered himself neither a
Tolstoyan nor a deliberate simplifier.... He often
spoke of the abnormality of our lives, of the necessity
of paying our debt to the laboring man, of the
advantages of physical labor. ‘See, I’m working,’
he’d say to any one who caught him busied with
axe or spade. ‘I’m helping my neighbor, my
porter, with his work.’ It was hard to tell whether
he was talking ironically or seriously.... At
noon Gavrilo’d come back and put his horse in
the stable, and M. Budnikov would go of on business<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_86" id="Page_86">[86]</a></span>
and make polite remarks to his tenants about
a broken fence or a piece of plaster knocked down
by children’s balls.... He often came back with
one or two beggars. They had asked him for alms
on the street and he’d offered ‘assistance through
toil.’ ... Of course, the rogues ran off shamefully,
but M. Budnikov took especial pleasure in
working, either alone or with Gavrilo. All the
beggars in the city soon got to know him and
bowed with a friendly smile, but did not ask for
money. ‘Why can’t you see what’s good for you,
my friends?’ he’d say meaningly. I must say
that a ‘life of toil’ did bring him manifest personal
benefits; his ruddy color was absolutely evident,
even, and healthy. His face was always quiet and
placid, and almost like Gavrilo’s.... It had
nothing malicious or strange in it.”</p>

<p>“I see, you’re back on your old theme!” said
the mathematician, standing up and striking his
companion’s shoulder. “Of course, nothing terrible....
I’m going out here.... Eight minutes’
wait.”</p>

<p>The train slowed down and stopped.</p>

<h4>III</h4>

<p>Pavel Semenovich, thus left without an audience,
looked around in despair. Soon his gray eyes met<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_87" id="Page_87">[87]</a></span>
mine. In his gaze I noticed an obstinate idea like
that of a maniac....</p>

<p>“You ... understand?” he said frankly,
wholly undisturbed by the fact that he was talking
to a stranger.</p>

<p>“I think so,” I answered.</p>

<p>“Good,” he said, with evident satisfaction, and
then he went on, as if he were talking to the same
person.</p>

<p>“I had, you know, a school friend named
Kalugin, Petr Petrovich. As a young man he was
infected with the tendencies of his age, but he
was a rare type. He said little. He preferred
to listen, and he watched how others failed, and he
tried, as is said, to turn the wheel of history....
But you could feel his rapture and his devotion
in his silence.... He finally came to the
conclusion: ‘Everything is good and extraordinarily
fine, but there is no lever. Money is the
lever. And you can’t do a thing without a hundred
thousand.’ You know, he succeeded in convincing
several of his friends of this and they formed a
small savings association. Of course, nothing
came of it: one simply got tired; fate placed another
too far from the source of gain. But Petr
Petrovich held on and won. He wasn’t brilliant,
but he was of a good character, and that kind of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_88" id="Page_88">[88]</a></span>
men get along well in business. He first went into
some sort of an institution along the Volga. It
wasn’t a bank nor a loan association. To get
ahead, he didn’t despise even this, and all of a
sudden he put new life into it, as they say. In
three years’ time, he was making about six thousand
a year.... He put the question this way:
‘Five twenties make a hundred! I’ll keep one
thousand a year and put five thousand away for
the cause. In twenty years my lever’ll be ready.’
More than that, he did it. Of course he had to
have a self-sacrificing character. And system!
First, to avoid all foolish accidents, he left his old
friends ‘for a time,’—those who tried to catch the
wheel of history in their bare hands. ‘I’ve got
my problem.... Ingratitude ... accidental notes
... do me the favor, it’s not necessary.’ ... And
he held out. He mastered his life and counted
every detail. Nothing—except making money!
He got up every day, not like Budnikov at seven
o’clock, but at thirteen minutes to seven. Second
by second! He gave up his personal life.... Up
to that time he had had only one pleasure: he got
intimate with a girl, but on a free basis. They gave
each other their word ‘not to bind each other.’
What a stupid phrase! A child gave its word to
no one.... It just appeared and demanded its<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_89" id="Page_89">[89]</a></span>
rights.... She was glad.... He was angry.
This unpleasant event might be repeated, he
thought, and, with an eye on his great cause, he
determined to enjoy his freedom. ‘I’ll give the
child a certain sum,’ he said, ‘even though it interferes
with my great cause.’ ... The woman also
had character. She never touched a cent of the
money, but snatched up the child,—and away forever....
How he felt afterwards, no one knows,
but he worked harder than ever to save money....
After various successes and failures, after
twenty years, during which he regularly got up at
thirteen minutes to seven, he congratulated himself
on his success. He had a hundred thousand.
He went to his work at the usual time, walked into
the office of his superior and said: ‘I’ll leave in
two months.’ They opened their mouths in amazement.
‘Are you crazy? Why? Can we raise
your salary? Give you a share of the profits?’ No!
He told why, and in two months he went to Moscow
to take up his old life. And he had a hundred
thousand in his pocket.”</p>

<p>“Oh, ho!” said Petr Petrovich, who just then
came back from the restaurant.... “Still talking
about Budnikov?”</p>

<p>“No,” answered Pavel Semenovich. “I was
talking about some one else.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_90" id="Page_90">[90]</a></span></p>

<p>“Some one else! Go on, I don’t care.... Go
on with the hundred thousand. I hope that’s not
terrible....”</p>

<p>His voice sounded as if it were mocking. Pavel
Semenovich looked at him in mild surprise and
turned to me.</p>

<p>“Yes, it’s like this.... He went to Moscow,—to
his past, you see.... He thought life would
wait, till he got rich.... He’d go to the same
newspaper corner, find the same arguments and
the same people, and they’d be grabbing at the
wheel of history with their hands as ever....
He’d show his lever.... ‘Permit me! You have
fine ideas.... Here’s my money to carry them
out.’ But there wasn’t a soul to offer it to; there
were other people in the corner, and they talked
differently. The others had perished under the
wheel of history, or had given up.... Life is like
a train.... If you leave the station for a time,
when you come back the train’s gone. Sometimes
you can’t even find the station. You understand
this tragedy, my friend?”</p>

<p>“But, excuse me,” said Petr Petrovich. “A
hundred thousand! Free! Many a man will be
willing to have this tragedy....”</p>

<p>“Yes? But this man, I tell you, was sincere.”</p>

<p>“What of it?”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_91" id="Page_91">[91]</a></span></p>

<p>“Just this.... He wandered around among
his old and new friends and kept looking for the
train.... He disgusted every one.... The
thing for which he had given his own life and
another’s was unintelligible; it’s just like losing
a finger when you don’t know what for. You
understand,—various, respectable affairs like a
‘people’s home’ or a paper or an ‘ideal book store’
don’t satisfy a seventy-year-old man.... He’s
ready then to give up interest and capital....”</p>

<p>“But at six per cent you can live modestly....
You can live!”</p>

<p>“Of course.... But if you want to do something....
This was an act of heroism.... He
gave his life as others do theirs.... And not only
his.... Would you do that for a little miserly
interest?... And there was no reason for his
heroism.... To sum up, one fine day they found
him in a lonely room in a hotel with a bullet in
his head.... And he had gotten rid of his money
somehow, quickly and quietly.... I saw him the
day before at a meeting of some society. No one
noticed him especially. They greeted him and
passed on; he was but a respectable man. Of a
strong character and the best of intentions. But
unusually dull!”</p>

<p>“H-m, yes!” said the mathematician. “There<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_92" id="Page_92">[92]</a></span>
are such cranks.” And he lay down to sleep.
His face, with its fat, clipped mustache, again
disappeared in the shadow, and you could see only
his feet and his checkered trousers. “I think,” he
growled from his corner, “that Budnikov is more
interesting. You’re not through with him....”</p>

<p>“Yes.... I ... excuse me,—it was all due to
chance.... I sat up all night recently.... I
was reading Budnikov’s correspondence with his
‘distant’ friend. Believe me, I could not tear myself
away, and you never would think that it was
written by that same Semen Nikolayevich Budnikov,
who drank tea and rum in my rooms, sent
Gavrilo downtown, and whose soul imperceptibly,
but almost before my eyes, dried up and grew
barren in our little house.... And it remained,
so to speak, without reverence for anything.”</p>

<h4>IV</h4>

<p>He stopped and looked at me bashfully and
questioningly, as if he felt that he had said something
which was not proper for a railroad conversation.
He was somewhat startled when the
mathematician exhaled a thick cloud of smoke from
his dark corner and said:</p>

<p>“Pavel Semenovich, I see you really are a<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_93" id="Page_93">[93]</a></span>
crank. Isn’t that so?... Wonderful!... A
man has a hundred thousand and shoots himself!
Another lives as he likes, so to speak, healthy and
ruddy.... A quiet soul.... Safe.... Is that
strange?... By heavens, it’s impossible....
Good night.... It’s time to go to sleep. Nothing,
nothing!... You won’t disturb me by talking....
I won’t listen....”</p>

<p>He turned to the wall.</p>

<p>Pavel Semenovich modestly and questioningly
looked at me with his naïve gray eyes, and began
in a lower tone:</p>

<p>“There’s a street in Tikhodol called Bolotnaya
(Swamp Street). They built a house on it near
me.... New and of fresh wood.... The first
year it shone so, and then it lost its freshness.
It got covered with that especial dirt and weathering
and rubbish. Then it got the same color as
the old stables and sheds and you couldn’t tell it
from them. Now they say it’s haunted.... The
people suddenly said that Budnikov had robbed a
woman.”</p>

<p>“That’s absolute nonsense,” called the mathematician.
“I’ll never believe that Budnikov was
a robber. That’s some stupid rumor.”</p>

<p>Pavel Semenovich smiled sadly and rather distractedly:</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_94" id="Page_94">[94]</a></span></p>

<p>“That’s what he was. A robber!... A robber
is the word, ... precisely! But it was just a
little personal ... tangle with rather vague outlines....
You see.... I must tell you that since
your time a mother and daughter moved in....
The women were simple and very poor and M.
Budnikov was their protector and friend. They
ran in debt for a long time, and he—always so
strict in affairs of this kind—stood it, and even
gave them money. For the doctor or for better
food, when one was sick. Finally the old woman
died and Yelena became an orphan. M. Budnikov
became very sympathetic, gave her a pleasant
little home, and got her work; she sewed,—got
along somehow.... Then she became a sort of
housekeeper for M. Budnikov, and then,—people
began to say that their relations became more
intimate....”</p>

<p>“Oh, oh!” yawned the mathematician. “They
didn’t need me for that.... Was she pretty?”</p>

<p>“Yes, rather pretty; fat, with flowing graceful
movements and mild eyes. They said she was
stupid. But, if she was, a woman’s stupidity is
often very peculiar.... A naïve and sleeping
innocence of soul. She felt her situation very
keenly. As is said in Uspensky, she was all shame....
M. Budnikov tried to teach her and lift her<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_95" id="Page_95">[95]</a></span>
up, so to speak, to his level. She seemed incapable
of it. She sat usually with a book, spelled it out
with her fingers, and her face was interested like
a child’s. She seemed to become dull and stupid
when Budnikov was around. He got sick of her
actions and then of Yelena, especially as other
things took up his attention. But there was a
time when he almost loved her. At least there
were indications of it. In a word, the breach was
not easy for him,—his conscience troubled him
and he wanted to silence it. He finally decided
to give her a ticket of the domestic lottery....
He called her, took out three tickets, put
them on the table, placed his hand on them, and
said:</p>

<p>“‘Look here, Yelena. One of these tickets may
win you two hundred thousand. Do you understand?’</p>

<p>“Of course she didn’t understand well. She
couldn’t imagine so large a sum, but he went on:</p>

<p>“‘Now, I’ll give you one. This paper is worth
365 rubles, but don’t sell it.... Take it and
may you be lucky....’</p>

<p>“She didn’t take it, but huddled up, as if she
were afraid. ‘All right,’ said M. Budnikov. ‘Give
me your hand and take this paper.’ He took
one of the tickets and guided her hand in making<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_96" id="Page_96">[96]</a></span>
two pencil strokes sharply and heavily. His mind
was clearly made up.... He gave it outright
with all the results, we may say. ‘You see,’ he
said, ‘this is yours, and if you win two hundred
thousand, they’ll be yours too.’ He placed it back
on the table. She reached out her hand and put
in her bosom a paper with the number of the
ticket.”</p>

<p>“Really?” asked the mathematician.</p>

<p>“Yes.... It had to happen so.... That
machine was working in Petersburg, throwing out
one number after another.... Children’s hands
pick them up.... And one of these tickets
won.”</p>

<p>“Two hundred thousand?” asked the mathematician,
with great interest; apparently he had
forgotten about sleeping.</p>

<p>“Not two hundred, but seventy-five.... During
March, M. Budnikov looked at the list of
drawings and saw that his number had won a
large prize. Zero, again zero ... 318 and 32.
Suddenly he remembered that he had given one
ticket to Yelena.... He also remembered that
there were two lines on the first. He had three
in a row: 317, 318 and 319. That means 317....
He got out the tickets and looked: there were
two lines on 317. Yelena had won....”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_97" id="Page_97">[97]</a></span></p>

<p>“The devil,” exclaimed the mathematician, raising
himself a little. “That’s luck!”</p>

<p>“Yes, it was. And she was so stupid. The
lines were on that number, when he thought that
he would give her another.... A mistake, a
mechanical wave of the hand, mere chance....
And, because of this chance, Yelena, a stupid
woman who understood nothing and did not know
what to do with money, would take from him ...
him, M. Budnikov, take away, so to speak, a large
sum of money. That was foolish, wasn’t it? He
was educated, had an aim in his life, or had had....
He might again. He would perhaps have
used the money for some good cause. He would
write again to his friend and ask his advice....
But she ... she? A beast with a round form and
beautiful eyes, which didn’t even show clearly
what was in them: the stupidity of a calf or the
innocence of a youth who had not yet grown to
conscious life.... Do you understand?... It
was so natural.... Any one in Budnikov’s place,
you ... I ... even Petr Petrovich, would have
felt the same way....”</p>

<p>Petr Petrovich made some sort of an indistinct
sound, which was susceptible of different interpretations.</p>

<p>“No?” said Pavel Semenovich. “Excuse me....<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_98" id="Page_98">[98]</a></span>
I’m speaking about myself.... My thoughts
or rather my inclinations would have been the
same, perhaps in the subconscious realm.... Because
... knowledge and all restraining influences
are a sort of bark, a thin cover under which
purely egoistic, primal and animal desires live
and move.... If they find a weak spot....”</p>

<p>“Fine, fine,” laughed Petr Petrovich condescendingly,
and I thought that he winked at me
from his dark corner. “Let’s get back to Budnikov....
What did he do? Pay it ... and
that’s all.”</p>

<p>“Apparently, yes; because he wanted to settle
the question and was a little afraid, he called
Yelena and congratulated her on winning. Then,
apparently wishing to make use of a favorable
opportunity, he hinted: ‘When we separate, you’ll
be all right.’ Then he got angry....”</p>

<p>“What for?”</p>

<p>“I think, because she was such a fool. If she’d
chosen then, she probably wouldn’t have taken
that number. But now it happened because of
her folly. An orderly and wise man lost that
money. That’s what I imagine from Yelena’s
story.... ‘He ran from one corner to another
and found fault with me.’ ...”</p>

<p>“What of her? Glad, of course?”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_99" id="Page_99">[99]</a></span></p>

<p>“N-no.... She was frightened and began to
weep. He got angry and she cried and he became
still more angry.”</p>

<p>“Really? What a fool!”</p>

<p>“Y-yes.... I’ve already explained: I don’t
call her wise, but weeping.... No, it wasn’t
foolishness.... When she told it to me afterwards
... she got to this point, looked at me
with her clear, bird-like eyes, and burst into tears.
Even now I can’t forget those eyes.... Foolishness,
perhaps, but there’s foolishness and foolishness.
It wasn’t clear knowledge and calculation
about the situation. But in those blue eyes there
was something very deep,—just as if a true instinct
shone in them.... Those foolish tears,
perhaps, were the only correct thing at that time....
I dare to say,—the wisest thing in the whole
confused story.... Somewhere, not far off, was
hidden the solution, like a secret door....”</p>

<p>“Fine, fine.... Go on!”</p>

<p>“Next, ... M. Budnikov looked a long time
intently at the foolish woman. Then he sat down
beside her, put his arms around her, and, for
the first time after the perceptible cooling of their
relations, he asked her not to go to her rooms, but
to spend the night with him....</p>

<p>“So things went on for some time. Yelena<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_100" id="Page_100">[100]</a></span>
bloomed.... Her love was ‘foolish’; it was
very direct. At first,—she told me herself,—M.
Budnikov was repugnant to her. Later, after he
had taken her, he dried her up, as she said. Such
direct feminine natures do not separate feelings
and facts, so to speak. Wherever you touch it,
the whole complex reacts together.... He came
back to her; therefore, he loved her.... For two
weeks she was so joyful and beautiful that every
one looked at her,—glad of her limitless joy....
But in two weeks M. Budnikov again cooled off....
A cold storm was raging in our yard....
Yelena’s eyes showed that she had been weeping....
The neighbors grumbled and pitied.
M. Budnikov was sullen.... Those two lines had
sunk deep into the hearts of both and a third felt
them.... The porter Gavrilo....”</p>

<p>“H-m! The whole story!” said Petr Petrovich,
again getting up and sitting down beside Pavel
Semenovich. “Was he there? Did he learn she’d
won?”</p>

<p>“He knew nothing about it. I’ve spoken of him.
A less clever person you could hardly imagine,—absolutely
heavenly directness.... Sometimes he
didn’t seem to be a man, but ... what shall I
say?... a simple collection of muscles, partially
conscious of their existence. He was constructed<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_101" id="Page_101">[101]</a></span>
properly, harmoniously, rightly, and always in
motion. And, in addition, two good human eyes
looked at the whole world from the point of view
of physical and moral indifference, so to speak....
Sometimes these eyes really gleamed with curiosity
and such unconscious excellence that you actually
felt jealous. Sometimes it seemed to me that if it
wasn’t Gavrilo himself, there was something in him
which understood M. Budinov, Yelena, and me....
He understood and smiled at us, just because
he did understand.... Suddenly the man became
confused.... It began when Budnikov
made up with Yelena and dropped her again....
To him she was an abandoned ‘master’s lady,’ a
creature which inspired in him no special respect,
and very probably his first advances seemed rather
simple and rustic. She met these advances with
deep hostility and anger. Then Gavrilo ‘began to
think,’ that is, began to eat little, become slack
in his work, grow thin, and generally to
dry up.</p>

<p>“This lasted during the fall and winter. Budnikov
finally grew cold to Yelena; she felt insulted
and believed that he was ‘laughing’ at her....
Gavrilo’s character was rather spoiled and the old
harmony between him and Budnikov disappeared....
And the ticket with the two lines on it lay<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_102" id="Page_102">[102]</a></span>
in the table drawer and seemed forgotten by
every one....</p>

<p>“Spring came with everything in this condition....
For a while I lost sight of the little drama
which was being enacted before my eyes.... My
examinations were coming on; I was very tired
and could not sleep. If you do fall asleep, you
awake with a start and can’t get to sleep again.
You light a candle,—your books are on the table,—you
begin to study.... And it’s sunrise.... You
go out on the steps, look at the sleeping street, the
trees in the garden.... A sleepy coachman is
going along the street; the trees are rustling
faintly, as if they were shivering in the morning
chill.... You envy the coachman, and even the
trees.... You want rest and this concentrated
unconscious life.... Then you go out in the garden....
Sit down on a bench and just get to
sleep, when the sun shines in your eyes. There
was just such a bench in a quiet corner by the
stable wall. When the sunlight fell on it at seven
o’clock you’d wake up, drink your tea, and go to
your classes.</p>

<p>“I went out one day at dawn and fell asleep
on this bench. Suddenly I woke up as if some
one had called me. The sun had scarcely risen
very high and the bench was still in the shadow.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_103" id="Page_103">[103]</a></span>
What’s the matter, I wondered.... What woke
me up? Suddenly I heard Yelena’s voice in
Gavrilo’s stable. I wanted to get up and leave....
I don’t like to be an eavesdropper and it was
rather unpleasant to hear the simple solution of
Yelena’s drama. But, while I was getting ready to
leave, the conversation continued and finally I
didn’t go.... I just listened.</p>

<p>“‘You see I’ve come,’ said Yelena.... ‘What
do you want?’</p>

<p>“Suddenly, with such a deep and simple grief,
she added:</p>

<p>“‘You’ve been torturing me....’</p>

<p>“She said this ... with such a sincere and
heartfelt groan. Before, yes, and after, she always
spoke formally to him, but that time ... a
woman’s heart, sick with shame and love, used
the form of affection,—frankly, unconditionally,
freely....</p>

<p>“‘You’ve tortured me, too, Yelena Petrovna,’
answered Gavrilo. ‘I’ve lost my strength. I’ve
dried up. I can’t work and I can’t eat....’</p>

<p>“‘What are you going to do now?’ asked Yelena.</p>

<p>“‘What?’ he said. ‘Marry you, of course.’</p>

<p>“For a few minutes neither spoke. Yelena
seemed to be weeping softly. And yet that silence
was wonderfully clear, simple, frank. ‘You see<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_104" id="Page_104">[104]</a></span>
the situation: you’re no match for me; I would
have worked for Budnikov as well as I could, gone
to the village, gotten a place, married and taken
some good girl.... But that’s past; willy nilly
I want you as you are....’</p>

<p>“‘I’m lost,’ said Yelena softly.</p>

<p>“‘Why, Yelena Petrovna,’ answered Gavrilo,
with a grim tenderness.... ‘I don’t see that
you’re lost.... It’s just the same.... I can’t
live.... Like a corpse.... I can’t eat....
I’ve got no strength....’</p>

<p>“Yelena wept more loudly.... She was having
a good cry. It seemed painful but healing. Gavrilo
said sternly:</p>

<p>“‘Come, what are you going to do?... Are
you coming?’</p>

<p>“Yelena apparently exerted herself, stopped
weeping, and answered the repeated question:</p>

<p>“‘Do you fear God, Gavrilo Stepanich?’</p>

<p>“‘Why?’ asked Gavrilo.</p>

<p>“‘You won’t find fault with me?’</p>

<p>“‘No,’ he said, ‘I won’t find fault with you.
And I won’t let any one else. If you’re serious
in throwing this overboard forever.... Forever....
I’ll trust you....’</p>

<p>“Silence. I didn’t hear Yelena’s answer. I
only imagined that she must have turned to the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_105" id="Page_105">[105]</a></span>
east, and perhaps there was an ikon in the room....
She crossed herself.... Then she suddenly
took his head in her arms and I heard them kiss.
That same instant Yelena ran out, rushed almost
to the house, but she suddenly stopped, opened
the gate, and came into the garden.</p>

<p>“Then she caught sight of me.... But it didn’t
embarrass her. She walked up, stopped, and looked
at me out of her happy eyes, and said:</p>

<p>“‘Do you always take a walk mornings?...
Friend....’</p>

<p>“Suddenly, overcome by her emotions, she came
nearer, took hold of my shoulders, shook me unceremoniously,
looked into my eyes, and laughed....
It was so naïve. She felt that I had been
listening and saw nothing bad in it.... When
Gavrilo came out with his broom and also entered
the garden, she blushed and ran past him. Gavrilo
looked after her with quiet joy, and then his gaze
fell on me. He bowed with his habitual quiet
politeness and commenced to sweep the path. He
again showed that same beautiful and effortless
play of healthy, free muscles.... And I remember
how the monastery bell sounded for early
matins,—it was Sunday. Gavrilo stopped in a
broad bay of the alley, took off his cap, held the
broom in his left hand, and crossed himself with<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_106" id="Page_106">[106]</a></span>
his right. The whole seemed to me so extraordinarily
bright and beautiful. The man stood in the
centre of a world of light, where everything was
very good, that is, all his relations to earth and
heaven.... In a word, it was so soothing a sight
that I went to my room and fell fast asleep after
so many sleepless nights. There’s something healing
and calming in honest human happiness. You
know it sometimes occurs to me that we are all
bound to be well and happy, because ... you see
... happiness is the highest possible condition of
spiritual health. And health is contagious like
disease.... We are so to speak open on all sides:
to the sun, wind, and other things. Others enter
us, and we them, without noticing it.... And
that’s why——”</p>

<p>Pavel Semenovich suddenly stopped as he
felt the fixed and cynical gaze of Petr Petrovich.</p>

<p>“Yes, yes!... Excuse me,” he said, “this is
really a little unclear....”</p>

<p>“It is a little. You’d better go on. Without
philosophy....”</p>

<p>“ ... M. Budnikov woke me up. It happened
to be the twentieth. He came as usual, and as
usual he drank two cups of tea with rum, but I
saw that M. Budnikov was out of humor, and even<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_107" id="Page_107">[107]</a></span>
nervous.... And I involuntarily connected it
with the incident of the morning.</p>

<p>“For some time he kept out of sorts and every
one around noticed that something secret and
hidden had gone wrong between master and
servant. Gavrilo wanted to leave.... Budnikov
would not let him go, although he often told me
that he was disappointed in Gavrilo. As I was
walking one day through the garden, I saw them
both standing by the gate and talking. Budnikov
was excited; Gavrilo, calm. He was standing in
an easy position and kept looking at his spade,
which was stuck in the ground. He was evidently
insisting on something which enraged Budnikov....
But I thought that the subject of conversation
created between them a strange equality....</p>

<p>“‘Yes, friend, of course, it’s your business,’
said M. Budnikov. He caught sight of me but
did not think it necessary to change the subject.
He spoke spitefully and angrily.... ‘Yes....
You’re a free man.... But just remember, Gavrilo
Stepanich, if you have any utilitarian object,
... I, of course, can give only a very small
sum....’</p>

<p>“M. Budnikov was unable to speak simply, and
used foreign words, even when talking to Gavrilo....<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_108" id="Page_108">[108]</a></span>
Gavrilo looked at him calmly and answered:</p>

<p>“‘We don’t want anything.... We have
enough....’</p>

<p>“M. Budnikov glanced cautiously at him and
answered:</p>

<p>“‘Fine! Remember! Afterwards.... I’ll go
to Petersburg on business.... Do what you
want to.’</p>

<p>“Gavrilo bowed and said:</p>

<p>“‘I thank you....’</p>

<p>“‘Excuse me,’ replied M. Budnikov, with a
shadow of ironical melancholy, ‘I don’t expect
gratitude.’</p>

<p>“He slammed the gate and left the garden.</p>

<p>“He stopped and waited for me in the yard,
took my arm, and came up to my rooms. On the
way, and in my apartments, he kept talking confusedly
and incoherently. He did not conceal the
fact that he had had some affection for a certain
woman. This might be still ‘alive under the ashes.’ ...
On the other hand he was dreaming of union
and the possibility of friendship with his humblest
brother. Although both of these feelings had led
to his disillusionment, he could show something, so
that every one would feel it.... But in general,
magnanimity and the finer feelings belong only to
highly cultured people....</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_109" id="Page_109">[109]</a></span></p>

<p>“He was nervous and under his rather artificial
pathos, I could see his real exasperation and
anger.</p>

<p>“I later had a chance to see his diary. These
were separate pages, written like letters to his
distant friend.... Apparently he hadn’t sent
any letters for a long time, but these pages were
like lights in the darkness. Under the approximate
day of the conversation with Gavrilo was a
passionate note. He told the whole story of
Yelena, and wrote that he had made a mistake,
and that he now loved her.... And that he would
try once more.... This ended with a sudden burst
of poetry: ‘My distant friend, you, of course, do
not doubt that I will do what I consider the duty
of magnanimity....’</p>

<p>“Then, sending Gavrilo one day with the horse
somewhere outside the city, M. Budnikov went to
the wing where Yelena still lived.</p>

<p>“‘Yelena! You should come to me. You must
fix up something....’</p>

<p>“A few days before this he had been thoughtful
and solemn, but now he dressed in style, went to
the wing, and entered Yelena’s room, without heeding
the inquisitive looks of his tenants.</p>

<p>“No one knew what happened in that room, but
a half-hour later M. Budnikov came out, stubborn,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_110" id="Page_110">[110]</a></span>
affected, but apparently dazed. Every one began
to say that he had formally proposed to Yelena
and—she had rejected him.</p>

<p>“After this he left for Petersburg, where he
had a lawsuit before the Senate. He lost it, and
when he returned, Gavrilo and Yelena were already
married.</p>

<h4>V</h4>

<p>“This made a great impression upon him, like
some great spiritual conversion. One apparently
insignificant circumstance especially surprised him.
Every spring flowers grew by the wall under
M. Budnikov’s windows. This Yelena did regularly,
and it was put down as an annual source of
expense: seed, a watering pot, to a blacksmith for
mending the spade.... In the early spring Yelena
used to set to work at it, gladly and merrily, and
M. Budnikov took a delighted interest in it. Now
that wing was neglected, the flower bed languished,
M. Budnikov’s windows seemed blind.... But
the other wing, where Gavrilo and his wife lived,
bloomed and flourished. A symbol. When M.
Budnikov came back from the station and took one
look at this unexpected contrast his face changed,
and for a short time he lost his usual aristocratic<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_111" id="Page_111">[111]</a></span>
air. I suddenly felt sorry for him. I went out
and invited him into my room. He sat with me
a long time and gave me his impressions of the
capital,—verbose, rambling, insincere. I kept feeling
that M. Budnikov’s soul was thinking of something
very far removed from his impressions of
the capital.</p>

<p>“Gradually everything drifted back into the old
channels. M. Budnikov still went twice a week
to his farm, still visited his tenants on certain
days, still prepared his dinner on an oil stove.
But there were more trifles in his diary; for example,
he began to note down how many steps he
took each day, and apparently counted thereby the
use and value of various things.</p>

<p>“In a short time another change took place:
M. Budnikov felt attracted to religion.</p>

<p>“I remember one fall evening.... It was one
of those evenings when nature touches your soul
especially. The stars seem to be waving and whispering
in the heavens, and the earth is covered
with light and shade.... Our little city, as you
know, is quiet and filled with foliage. You go out
in the evening and sit down on your steps. And
so with the other houses along the street; here’s
one person on a bench by the gate, another on the
dirt bank, another on the grass.... People are<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_112" id="Page_112">[112]</a></span>
whispering about themselves, the trees about themselves,—and
there’s a hardly perceptible hum.
Yes, and something’s whispering in your soul. You
unconsciously review your whole life. What was
and what is left, where you came from, what’s
going to happen? Then, everything ... the
meaning of your life in the general economy of
nature, so to speak, ... nature, where all the
stars sink, unnumbered, unlimited, ... they
gleam and shine.... And speak to your soul.
Sometimes it’s sad and deep and quiet.... You
feel you’re going to the wrong place. You begin
to think what’s there above.... You want to run
away from this reproving beauty, this exalted
calm, with your load of confusion, and you want
to melt away in it.... You’ve no place to go....
You enter your office, look at all your things
in the lamp-light ... text-books, copy-books with
answers written by your pupils.... And you ask:
where’s there anything alive?...”</p>

<p>Petr Petrovich muttered something and the narrator
stopped again.</p>

<p>“Well ... that was the way I felt and I was
sitting on my steps and thinking: here’s the people
coming from vespers.... What of it? That’s the
way they find their relations to the infinite....
Or else it’s nothing but habit, mere automatic motion.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_113" id="Page_113">[113]</a></span>
I prefer it to be real. Suddenly I saw one
man leave the crowd and come towards me. It
turned out to be M. Budnikov. He had been to
vespers. He sat down beside me.</p>

<p>“I felt that M. Budnikov was waiting, you know,
for me to ask him why he went to church. He
never had gone and was always sarcastic about religion,
but now he had suddenly commenced to go.
I was really interested and the evening led me to
be frank.... Why not say, I thought, that there’s
a cloud on my soul....</p>

<p>“Yes, Semen Nikolayevich, ...” I said ... “I
look at the sky and think....</p>

<p>“He nodded and commenced:</p>

<p>“‘That tortured me, too ... and I suffered....
And like you, I saw no solution. But the solution
is so plain....’</p>

<p>“He pointed toward the church, a white spot
showing through the trees.</p>

<p>“‘We, intelligent people,’” he said, “‘are
frightened, so to speak, by the beaten path, banality.
But,—we must drop our pride and fuse ...
or as Tolstoy once said,—partake of the common
cup, search with the humble faith of humanity ...
cease examining the foundations of life.... Like
Antaeus, so to speak, we must touch our common
mother....’</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_114" id="Page_114">[114]</a></span></p>

<p>“He spoke rather nicely. His voice was so
sleepy and murmured like the bass in the episcopal
choir. I’ll tell you the truth: I felt envious....
Really you could feel the quiet and blessing....
As M. Budnikov said, it was worth while to fuse,
and all these searchings of the heart are healed as
by the holy oil. Suddenly I found the lost meaning.
I asked myself: what’s the use of these books?
Why all these notes, all this quiet life?... Why
is this bootmaker solemn and satisfied? Mikhailo
looks for no special meaning, but he floats along
with the general current of life, that is, he agrees
with its general significance and meaning. People
go maybe once a week into this little white building
which looks out so attractive through the trees;
they spend a little time in communion with some
mystery—and see, for a week they are supplied
with the idea of meaning.... And many live a
harder life than I do....</p>

<p>“There’s M. Budnikov.... Had he really
found <i>this</i> for himself and solved his troubles?
I almost asked, but our priest went by just then.
M. Budnikov bowed and he returned it pleasantly.
And he looked at me with questioning kindness....
Budnikov has been converted and may bring back
another wanderer. I answered the bow rather
warmly and gratefully, and again felt like asking<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_115" id="Page_115">[115]</a></span>
M. Budnikov, but another person of an entirely
different character put in an appearance....”</p>

<h4>VI</h4>

<p>Pavel Semenovich thought for a moment and
then asked Petr Petrovich:</p>

<p>“Did Rogov ever study with you?”</p>

<p>“Rogov ... I don’t remember ... I’ve had
so many....”</p>

<p>“He was remarkable and our council often discussed
him.... His fate was peculiar.... You
see, the boy’s father was a rascal of the old school,
a slanderer, drunkard and a quarrelsome fellow,
and as much bothered by modern times as a wolf is
by hunters. He came too late. Rough manners unfitted
for the present times. He spent his last days
in trouble, poverty, and drunkenness. He always
thought that fate did not treat him fairly; people
got along well, but he, as he thought,—a model of
activity,—was dirty, hungry and oppressed....
And imagine,—this man had a family ... a wife
and son....</p>

<p>“The wife was irresponsible; her whole being
had been crushed in the full sense of the word, except
one corner of her soul. When anything concerned
her son, a door seemed to open into her completely<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_116" id="Page_116">[116]</a></span>
stupefied soul, which was like a citadel uncaptured
in the midst of a fallen city, and so much
wifely heroism came out through this gate that at
times the old ruffian and drunkard put his tail between
his legs. God knows what this cost her, but
she succeeded just the same in giving her son an
education. When I went to teach in Tikhodol, I
found this fellow in the last class. He was a bashful,
apparently modest boy and behaved quietly;
but his eyes had such an expression, strange, restrained;
I confess it made you uneasy: a curious
fire, like the flame of a restless, internal conflagration.
His thin, drawn face was always pale and a
crop of brown hair fell over his rough forehead.
He learned easily, made few friends among his
schoolmates, seemed to hate his father and loved
his mother almost abnormally.</p>

<p>“Now ... excuse me.... I must say a few
words about myself. Otherwise you won’t understand
a lot of what’s coming.... I’d only been
teaching a very few years and had the usual
idea.... I looked at my calling as noble, so to
speak, from the ideal point of view. My companions
seemed a holy regiment, yes ... the gymnasium
almost a temple.... You know, young
people feel that way and value it highly.... You
run to this light with every trouble and every question....<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_117" id="Page_117">[117]</a></span>
It’s the living soul of our business....
What shall I say, when he comes to you, a fellow
with his young soul under his uniform with all its
buttons sewed on.... I, the teacher, need him
with his questions and errors.... And he needs
me to search and study.... Honestly you want
to guide them....”</p>

<p>The narrator paused and continued in a low
voice:</p>

<p>“That’s the way it was with me.... I got intimate
with several boys from my classes, among them
Rogov.... Gave them books, and they visited me.
You understand, over a samovar, simply, heart to
heart. I remember this as the finest time of my
life.... Every time you open a new journal, you
find conversation, discussion, argument. I listened,
without interfering at first, to the way they wandered
and argued, and then I explained,—carefully
but pleasantly. You see, you get one thought and
then another, and again it comes so sharp that it
scratches you.... And you feel how you need to
restrain yourself and think and study. And you
grow with them.... And live....</p>

<p>“It didn’t last long. One day my director called
me in for a confidential conversation.... Well,
you know the rest.... This ‘extracurricular’ influence
of the leaders of youth does not enjoy protection.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_118" id="Page_118">[118]</a></span>
Journals already!... The director, you
know him,—Nikolay Platonovich Popov,—is a fastidious
man.... He merely hinted and afterwards
acted as if he really knew nothing.... I almost got
angry; at first I even refused to obey, and appealed
to the highest understanding of my obligations.
Then ... I saw that it was no use. The main
point was that I wasn’t the only one getting talked
about: the boys were getting a bad reputation....
That was hard and difficult enough but what could
I say to my young disputants? How could I explain
it? I obeyed the evidently senseless and
humiliating order! This was the first blow that life
had dealt me and I did not notice at the time that
I had received a mortal wound.</p>

<p>“I obeyed and stopped my evening discussions.
I can conscientiously say that I thought even more
about them. But youths, you know, don’t obey
so easily and can’t understand the whole meaning.
One evening this Rogov came to me with a companion.
Secretly. Flushed faces, blazing eyes, and
a peculiar look.... I stopped this kind of fellowship.
‘No,’ I said, ‘gentlemen, we’d better stop
it.’ I saw that both boys were getting worked up.
Rogov began to say something, but he had a convulsion
of the throat and his eyes suddenly took
on an evil expression.... I found a way to justify<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_119" id="Page_119">[119]</a></span>
myself: I was afraid for them, especially for Rogov
and his mother.... You see, if our conspiracies
were discovered, his whole career—and his mother’s
heroism—would have gone for nothing. So I
yielded ... for the first time....</p>

<p>“In place of this I tried to make my lessons as
interesting as possible. My evenings were free....
It was boring. I’d begun to get accustomed
to my young circle. And now—nothing. I went
for my books. Worked like a dog and kept thinking:
this must be interesting to them; it will be new
and it answers such and such questions.... I read
and dug in my books, collected everything interesting,
attractive, that pushed apart the official walls
and the official lessons.... I kept thinking of
those conversations.... And I thought I was getting
results.... I remember the whole class almost
died from zeal.... Suddenly the director began
to attend the lessons. He’d come in, sit down, and
listen without saying a word.... You know what
happened next. You act as if it were nothing, but
both you and the class feel it’s not a lesson but a
sort of investigation.... Again delicate questions
on the side: ‘Really, excuse me, but where did you
get this? Out of what official text book? How do
you think this agrees with the courses of study?’</p>

<p>“I’ll be brief.... In a word, the enthusiasm<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_120" id="Page_120">[120]</a></span>
finally died out of me.... The class became
merely a class: the living people began to retire
further and further; they disappeared in a sort of
fog.... I lost intellectual contact. Remarks ...
plan ... the enumeration of the stylistic beauties
of a live work. In this there are twelve beauties.
First ... second ... and so on.... It fitted the
program.... That is, you understand, I didn’t
notice how I dried up just like Budnikov.</p>

<p>“Anyway this young fellow finished his course
and went to the capital.... He didn’t get into
the university right away. It was the time of secret
denunciations.... Perhaps my lectures were suspicious.
To sum up,—he lost a year. He wrote
his mother that he had entered and had a fellowship,
but he really beat his way along, was poor
and probably got disgusted. Then he began to
tramp. Suddenly he had a great sorrow: his
mother died before he could get home. As soon as
her son left home, she began to waste away....
The guiding star of her life, so to speak, disappeared
from the horizon—and she lost the power
of resistance. Died of consumption, you know,
quickly, almost gladly. ‘Vanya doesn’t need me
any more,’ she’d say. ‘I got him on the right track,
thank God. He’ll get along now.’ She said the
Nunc Dimittis and died. Soon after they found<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_121" id="Page_121">[121]</a></span>
the honored father in a ditch. And my Rogov was
an orphan....</p>

<p>“The old woman was really in too much of a
hurry; her son really needed her more than ever.
He learned well and eagerly, so to speak, without
wasting his time, as if he were hurrying somewhere.
When he heard of his mother’s death, something
broke in his soul.... In turn she seemed to have
been the only ideal in his life. ‘I’ll finish, get on
my feet, revive my shattered truth: even though
she’s ready to die, mother’ll know that there is
divine blessing, love, and gratitude.... For a
year, a month, even a week.... An instant even,
for her heart to be filled and melted with joy.’
Suddenly, in place of everything, the grave.... A
crash ... and it’s all over! There’s no need of
gratitude, nothing to go back to, to correct....
You’ve got to have strength to stand such a temptation
without being shattered.... You need faith
in the general meaning of life.... It mustn’t
seem to you but blind chance....</p>

<p>“He didn’t hold on. He had no support....
He changed, got rough, and began to drink in with
his wine a poisonous feeling of insult and of the
injustice of fate.... So it went. He threw up
his examinations—what was the use of getting a
diploma? He drifted along like an empty boat<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_122" id="Page_122">[122]</a></span>
on a river.... He came back to our city....
Perhaps he wanted to tie up by his mother’s grave....
But how could that help him?... If he’d
tried to find some meaning, that would have been
another thing.... And so ... he got in court a
certificate, ‘to travel’ on business, and followed his
father’s footsteps. He lived a dissolute life, spent
his time in saloons, with worthless people, and engaged
in business of the most shady character. One
year of this life,—and he’d become a drunken,
impudent bum, the enfant terrible of our peaceful
city, a menace to the citizens. The devil knows
how, but the bashful boy became insolent and diabolically
clever: every one in the city was afraid
of him.... It’s strange, but there isn’t a city in
Russia without its Rogov. A sort of a state character.
It was quiet everywhere, peaceful slumber,
idyllic calm, M. Budnikov walking along the
streets, obstinate, conceited, counting his steps....
Evenings, especially on holidays, these poetic murmurs,
and there’s a lot of noise from some saloon
like our ‘On the Crags,’ and some misshapen, sick
and desperate soul carousing.... Satellites
around, of course. This is a natural and necessary
detail to fill up the provincial corners, so to
speak....</p>

<p>“Rogov met me soon after he turned up.... He<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_123" id="Page_123">[123]</a></span>
bowed shyly and went to one side, especially when
he was drunk. One time I met him, spoke to him,
and asked him in.... He came ... sober, serious,
even bashful ... from old habit, of course....
But we didn’t stick together. Memories
parted us: I was a young teacher with a lively
faith in my calling, with lively feelings and words:
He was a young man, still pure and respecting my
moral authority.... Now he was Vanka Rogov, a
Tikhodol bum, engaged in shady business....
And I.... In a word, we seemed to be parted by
a solid wall: the main reason of all I won’t mention.
I felt that I had to shatter the barrier, tell him
something that would reach his soul and control
it as I used to.... He seemed to be waiting for
this in terror: waiting for the cruel blow....
His eyes showed his pain and expectation.... I
didn’t have the strength. It was gone, ... lost
probably when for the first time we parted in
shame....</p>

<p>“I had to watch like a sympathetic witness, so
to speak, how this young fellow degraded himself,
grew fast, drank, and defiled himself.... He got
insolent, lost all sense of shame. Then I heard
that Rogov was an extortioner and begging. Business
was poor; he was on the border between the
merely offensive and the criminal. He was as clever<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_124" id="Page_124">[124]</a></span>
as an acrobat and laughed at everything. In two
or three years he was absolutely transformed. He
had become a menacing, dirty, and very unpleasant
figure.</p>

<p>“Sometimes he’d come when he was drunk....
It’s strange: but I seemed to feel more at home
when he was that way.... It simplified matters,
his fault was evident, and it was easier to draw
a moral. I remember after one of his descents into
the loathsome, I said to him:</p>

<p>“‘This and that’s not right, Rogov.’</p>

<p>“He shrugged his shoulders, turned away his
eyes, as if he was afraid of a moral beating; then
he shook his hair, looked me straight in the eye, obviously
relying on his impudence:</p>

<p>“‘What’s wrong, Pavel Semenovich?’</p>

<p>“‘It’s disgraceful,’ I said.</p>

<p>“‘You know,’ he said, ‘I’ve changed one quarrelsome
goal for another not less quarrelsome. That
was wrong and now it’s disgraceful. My theory
works out all right for me,’ he said. ‘Honor and
everything like that is nothing but dessert. You
know it comes after dinner. If there’s no dinner,
what’s the use of dessert?...’</p>

<p>“‘But, remember, Rogov,’ I said, ‘why you have
no dinner.... You studied well, had a good start,
and then suddenly went wrong....’</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_125" id="Page_125">[125]</a></span></p>

<p>“That moment I thought my statement was not
only convincing but incontrovertible.... And he
looked at me, laughed, and said:</p>

<p>“‘You’ve sometimes played billiards a little,
haven’t you?’</p>

<p>“‘Yes,’ I said, ‘I play for relaxation....’</p>

<p>“‘You know the downward stroke?’</p>

<p>“‘Yes.’ You know that’s a peculiar and paradoxical
shot. The ball first goes forward and then
it suddenly and apparently of its own accord rolls
back.... At first sight it seems incomprehensible
and a violation of the laws of motion, but it’s really
simple.</p>

<p>“‘Well, what do you think?’ he asked. ‘Has the
ball a will of its own? No.... It’s merely a
contest between two different motions.... One
rules in the beginning, the other later.... Now
you see,’ he said, ‘all her life my mother went
straight but father, as you know, spun around like
a top. That’s why I went straight at first, as long
as my mother’s impulse lasted.... I hadn’t gotten
my bearings, when I swung round to father’s pattern....
There’s my whole story....’</p>

<p>“He spoke frankly and hopelessly. He dropped
his head, shook his hair down over his face, and
then, when he looked at me again, I felt uneasy.
His eyes showed his pain. Did you ever see a sick<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_126" id="Page_126">[126]</a></span>
animal?... A dog,—usually an affectionate brute,
is willing then to bite its master.</p>

<p>“‘Now,’ he said, ‘whom do you think’s to
blame?’</p>

<p>“‘I don’t know, Rogov. I’m not your judge....
It’s not a question of blame....’</p>

<p>“‘Not of blame, what then? I think he’s to
blame who started me off with that shot.... That
means to condemn no one. I’m a case of downward
stroke in life.... I do the will of Him that sent
me.... So there you are, my dear Pavel Semenovich....
Have you got two grivens of silver? I
want to drown my sorrow....’</p>

<p>“This was the first time that he had asked
me for two grivens and I instantly felt that
the old barrier between us had been broken.
Now he could insult me as he would any one
else.</p>

<p>“I wanted to defend myself.</p>

<p>“‘No, Rogov. I won’t give you two grivens.
Come any time you feel like.... I’m glad to see
you.... But this is impossible....’</p>

<p>“He dropped his shaggy head, sat down, and
said dully:</p>

<p>“‘Yes, Pavel Semenovich. Excuse me. I’ll
come without begging. Yet to sit down with you,
I feel easier and free from my usual load.’</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_127" id="Page_127">[127]</a></span></p>

<p>“He sat still. A long, strained silence ensued.
Then he said:</p>

<p>“‘There was a time ... when I hoped to receive
something from you.... You don’t know what
you meant to me. Even now I sometimes feel I
must see you. You’re waiting for something....
No.... It’s hopeless.... A downward stroke
and it’s all over....’</p>

<p>“‘Excuse me, Rogov,’ I said. ‘You’re really
misusing that example from billiards. You’re not
an ivory ball but a living man.’</p>

<p>“‘And for that reason, I feel.... As for a
ball,—wherever you send it,—into a pocket or a
hole, that ivory ball doesn’t care.... But a man,
most esteemed Pavel Semenovich, finds it hard to be
pocketed.... Do you think that any one willingly
and voluntarily refuses dessert?... I wouldn’t....
I’m a man with reflexes, as they say. I see
and examine my trajectory clear to the end....
I’ll become a pig of pigs and I can’t reform. At
times I think ... perhaps ... somehow ... somewhere
... there may be some ... point of support....
Sometimes you get irritated ...
really.... Where is truth ... reality?... Is there
such a thing, Pavel Semenovich?’</p>

<p>“‘Of course there is,’ I answered.</p>

<p>“‘How sincerely you spoke. There must be, of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_128" id="Page_128">[128]</a></span>
course ... there is.... But where? Excuse me,
I don’t want to catch you.... You don’t know
yourself. You looked once and stopped. That’s
why I’ll only ask you for two grivens. Sometimes
I may be sitting by a fire.... You’re a man with
a soul.... Another time, perhaps, I’ll be able to
get more out of you....’</p>

<p>“‘Listen here,’ I said to him. ‘Think now, can
I really help you in any way?’ I felt that there
was something to him.... He was rather touched,
was not insolent.... He became thoughtful and
dropped his head.</p>

<p>“‘No,’ he replied, ‘it can’t be done. You’re
not to blame, friend. Because ... I, and every
one like me, is very greedy. Like swine we wallow
in the mire, and we want any one who helps us
to be whiter than snow.... You need a lot of
strength, friend. You haven’t enough.... A
storm is necessary.... To breathe fire....
There are miracles.... But you.... You’re not
angry at me?...’</p>

<p>“‘Angry? Why?’</p>

<p>“We both stopped talking. I had nothing to
say to him, he began again to walk around, but
he gradually recovered his former manner. He
came and sat down and he showed his brandy. The
next Saturday he came in the same condition and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_129" id="Page_129">[129]</a></span>
sat down beside me on the steps. Just then the
bell rang for vespers. In a short time M. Budnikov
came out of the gate. Dandy, you know how he is,
stubborn as ever, perfectly self-satisfied.... He
breathes forth the consciousness of duty well done.</p>

<p>“I remember what an unpleasant effect he produced
upon me. Rogov’s face suddenly changed.
He jumped up, adopted a theatrical pose, took off
his cap, and said:</p>

<p>“‘To M. Budnikov, Semen Nikolayevich, on his
way to vespers is extended the most respectful
greeting of Vanka Rogov.</p>

<p>“Then with a sweeping wave of his cap, he began
to sing—from a well-known romance:</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">
<div class="verse">“‘<i>I can n-no l-longer pay at all....</i></div>
<div class="verse"><i>Remem-mber me, m-my friend beloved....</i>’</div>
</div>
</div>

<p>“This buffoonery was too much.... I felt that I
disliked Budnikov, but yet.... He was insulting
a man on a point which from every angle and in
any case should have won his respect. Yelena
soon came out of the gate and also started for
church. He sang to me:</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">
<div class="verse">“‘<i>Ophelia! Nymph! Remember me</i></div>
<div class="verse"><i>In those most sacred prayers of thine.</i>’</div>
</div>
</div>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_130" id="Page_130">[130]</a></span></p>

<p>“This made me really angry. Yelena quailed
before the impudent stare and insolent, even if
unintelligible words. She dropped her head and
quickly walked to church.</p>

<p>“‘Listen, Rogov,’ I said. ‘You ought to be
ashamed of yourself! I must tell you ... if you
want to come here, I humbly beg you to act more
decently....’</p>

<p>“He turned and I saw in his eyes a peculiar
expression—of evil pain. He felt like biting me....</p>

<p>“I tried to soften the bitterness of my words and
said:</p>

<p>“‘Rogov, you don’t know these people, nor their
relations, and yet you venture to insult them....’</p>

<p>“He smiled at me and replied:</p>

<p>“‘You’re thinking of the idyl? The kindly
M. Budnikov made two hearts happy. Why, here’s
Gavryushenka.’</p>

<p>“In truth, Gavrilo had just come out of the gate.
Rogov beckoned to him rather hostilely....</p>

<p>“‘I congratulate you, Gavryushenka, ... on
your master’s leavings.... Wise fellow! You
knew where the crabs winter.... In case of necessity,
you may depend upon my legal knowledge....’</p>

<p>“Surprising how these cynics find things out.
Evidently Rogov knew the whole story and suspected
Gavrilo of having mercenary motives....</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_131" id="Page_131">[131]</a></span></p>

<p>“He walked up and patted him on the shoulder....
Gavrilo got angry and pushed Rogov away
violently. Rogov almost fell down, laughed, and,
with pretended indifference, started along the path.
He came up to me, stopped and said:</p>

<p>“‘Most esteemed Pavel Semenovich.... I want
to ask you a question: haven’t you read ... it’s
in Xenophon ... the conversation between Alcibiades
and Pericles?... If you haven’t, I recommend
it most highly. Although it’s in a dead
language, it’s instructive.’</p>

<p>“He went off singing an indecent song. A little
while after I hunted up this dialogue. I wondered
what he meant....</p>

<p>“You know it’s a hard but a powerful piece.
The subject’s about like this: Young Alcibiades
went one day to Pericles.... Remember, Pericles
was already a famous man and enjoyed the confidence
of every one ... because of past services
and a certain air of benevolence.... Anyway his
position was secure. Alcibiades was a rascal,
worthless, drunkard, in all sorts of scandals with
Athenian girls, cut off dogs’ tails, as you know ...
A man of no reputation for well-doing. Well, one
day, this rogue of a young fellow went up to
Pericles and said: ‘Listen, Pericles, you’re a man
chock full of benefactions clear to the top of your<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_132" id="Page_132">[132]</a></span>
head, you may say. I’m wandering off the road
and twisting up everything, for I have nothing to
do. Every one’s angry at me. I want you to
explain everything to me.’ Pericles, of course, was
willing and thought it was a good idea to talk to
the young man. He might bring him to his senses.
So he said: ‘Go ahead and ask what you want.’
Then came the question: ‘What is doing well?
How do you learn it?’ Pericles, of course, laughed:
‘Honor the gods, obey the laws, and do your duty.
To obey the laws is the first duty of a citizen and
a man.’ ‘Fine,’ answered the young fellow. ‘Tell
me, please, which laws am I to obey: the bad or
the good ones?’ Pericles was almost insulted. ‘If
a law’s a law, it’s good. What are you talking
about?’ ‘No,’ said Alcibiades, ‘wait and don’t get
angry.’ ... You know at this time in Athens all
these principles were mixed up ... parties, struggle,
some robbing others, ostracism, a sort of banishment
by administrative order ... usurpers ...
favorites ... there really was confusion,—a man
jumped forward and drew up his own laws for his
own advantage or for his relatives and friends.
Then old gods were all mixed up, the oracles answered
anything, provided it didn’t apply to the
subject. In a word, everything that was clear in
life had become unclear: there was no equilibrium,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_133" id="Page_133">[133]</a></span>
no generally acknowledged truth.... A new
system was necessary. Clouds covered the sky
and there were no stars to steer by.... That was
why Alcibiades asked what laws should be obeyed;
those which prescribe good or bad. Of course,
Pericles answered the good. ‘How can I tell which
are good? What is the mark, so to speak?’ ‘Obey
all! That’s what laws are for!...’ ‘That means
laws passed by the power of tyrants?’ ‘No, you
don’t need to obey those....’ ‘I see, only lawful
laws, so to speak. Fine! But suppose the
minority coerces the majority to its own advantage,
don’t I need to obey those laws?’ ‘Of course not.’
‘But if the majority coerce the minority, is that
contrary to right?...’ You see what the young
fellow was driving at: he didn’t need external
signs, but he showed that he needed to feel in his
soul universal truth, the highest truth, so to speak,
the truth of life, sanctity.... Pericles, you see,
hadn’t understood this.... Not merely Pericles,
the whole country rested on slavery, on past wrong....
Religion had dried up, the old sanctity which
had consecrated every step, every motion, the whole
order, all human relationships,—people had ceased
to feel it.... But Pericles argued around....
He didn’t want to confess that their laws had died....
He patted the dissolute young fellow on the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_134" id="Page_134">[134]</a></span>
shoulder with a great deal of condescension and
said: ‘Yes, yes.... I see you’ve got a head on
your shoulders. Years ago we used to settle such
hard questions.’ ... Well, Alcibiades saw that
Pericles was, so to speak, a recognized authority,
was quibbling over trifles, didn’t treat these conflicts
as anything alive,—and waved his hand. ‘I’m
sorry, my dear sir, that I didn’t know you then....
Now I’m bored; I’m going to fool along.’</p>

<p>“And that’s what he recommended to me, his
former teacher....”</p>

<h4>VII</h4>

<p>The narrator stopped. The train, which was
approaching another station, began to slow down.
Petr Petrovich reached out his hand and said, as
he took his blue cap with a cockade from the
hook:</p>

<p>“I’m going again to get something to eat....
I confess, my dear Pavel Semenovich, I don’t see
what you’re driving at.... Excuse me, it’s not
philosophy, and God only knows what you are after.
We began with Budnikov. All right, we know him....
Now the devil knows who this Rogov is, a
worn-out rogue, and now I don’t know whether
you’re talking of Xenophon or Alcibiades....<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_135" id="Page_135">[135]</a></span>
Cutting off dogs’ tails.... The devil knows what
you mean.... Kindly allow me to ask how all
this concerns me.... Just as you wish.... I’d
better go and get some more vodka....”</p>

<p>He put on his cap, and, holding on to the wall
because of the jolting of the train, he went out
of the compartment. Just at that moment the
fourth passenger on the other upper bench stirred.
He had been lying in the shadow, smoking now and
then, and he seemed to be interested in the story.
He got down, took a seat beside us and said:</p>

<p>“Excuse me, I haven’t the honor of being acquainted,
but I couldn’t help hearing your story
and it interested me. So, if you have no objections.”</p>

<p>Pavel Semenovich looked at him. He was a
cultured man, carefully dressed, with intelligent
eyes which looked steadily through a pair of gold
glasses which he was constantly adjusting.</p>

<p>“Yes?” said Pavel Semenovich. “I see, you
heard this....”</p>

<p>“Yes. It interested me.... Your point of
view, I confess, I don’t understand fully....”</p>

<p>“Really, it wasn’t any too clear.... I meant
... that in reality everything is so related....
And this mutual relationship....”</p>

<p>“Presupposes mutual responsibility?”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_136" id="Page_136">[136]</a></span></p>

<p>Pavel Semenovich’s face suddenly beamed with
joy.</p>

<p>“There! You understand it?... Yes, general....
Not before Ivan or Petr.... Everything is
connected, so to speak.... One man carelessly
throws away a brandy cork and another slips on it
and breaks his leg.”</p>

<p>The new acquaintance listened attentively. Just
then Petr Petrovich came back. He had been mistaken
as to the place and with an ironical glance
at both, he said, as he hung up his cap:</p>

<p>“Well, now,—what do you want with a cork?”</p>

<p>“No, Petr Petrovich,” said Pavel Semenovich
seriously, “you’re wrong.... The question is, so
to speak——”</p>

<p>“You find questions everywhere in the simplest
things,” said Petr Petrovich. “Don’t bother about
me. You’ve got a large enough audience.”</p>

<p>“Go on, please,” said the gentleman with the
gold glasses.</p>

<p>“If you wish.... I’ll be more than glad, for
I’ve got to get it off my mind. I stopped——”</p>

<p>“You stopped,” said Petr Petrovich laughingly,
“with Alcibiades.... A story, so to speak, from
the Ancient Times. Now for the Middle Ages....”</p>

<p>Pavel Semenovich paid no attention to this sally
and turned to the new member of the group:</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_137" id="Page_137">[137]</a></span></p>

<p>“You see how it was. The thing was this way:
Gavrilo was married and living by himself.... In
M. Budnikov’s table still lay the ticket with the
two lines.... There were ugly rumors about it
and, of course, they were exaggerated. Gavrilo was
the only one who didn’t know of them. He kept
on working as before, did all he could, and tried....
He was a muscular symphony in performance,
with his eyes full of general satisfaction and good
humor....</p>

<p>“And then Rogov suddenly turned up. He was
walking along the path by the yard; he stopped,
thought a moment, and called Gavrilo.</p>

<p>“He was a good-hearted Russian.... He had
pushed Rogov away a little while before, but afterwards
he thought no more of it. ‘What do you
want?’ he asked. ‘Come here, it’s something that
concerns you. You’ll thank me for it.’</p>

<p>“I’ll confess, something warned me. I felt like
calling to Rogov and stopping him, for I was sure
he was up to some mischief. But it was after
the Alcibiades episode ... and I had no hope in
my influence. I stayed at the window. I saw
Gavrilo leave his shovel, go up and listen. At first
his face showed that he did not comprehend and
almost did not care. Then, with the same air of
uncertainty, he took off his apron, went into the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_138" id="Page_138">[138]</a></span>
house, put on his cap and rejoined Rogov. Both
walked down the street and turned down the hill
toward the river. A moment later Yelena came
out to the gate, stood and looked after the two men....
Her eyes looked sad and frightened....</p>

<p>“From that day on Gavrilo’s character changed
sharply. He came back apparently rather drunk....
Perhaps from vodka, perhaps from the weight
of an unbearable burden which Rogov had suddenly
put on his shoulders.... In the first place, the
amount was absolutely staggering: a mountain of
money more than he could count. Then the source
of the wealth reminded him of Yelena’s past.
Finally he couldn’t understand why she had never
mentioned it and this may have given rise to evil
suspicions.... You see it was like an explosion in
his mind.... Those two lines which M. Budnikov
had made on the ticket kept sinking deeper and
deeper into Gavrilo’s soul.... The simple-hearted
man was absolutely upset. The whole symphony
of directness and labor was suddenly interrupted....
Gavrilo wandered around in confusion, as if
he had been poisoned....</p>

<p>“It began to break him down.... At first he
walked about grimly with his face clouded. His
work began to fall from his hands: he threw down
his axe and broke his spade.... Just like a well-built<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_139" id="Page_139">[139]</a></span>
machine into which some one has hurled a
bolt.... When Budnikov in surprise began to
administer mild rebukes, that shovels cost money
and he would have to take it out of Gavrilo’s wages,
that easy-going man answered with unintelligible
and unreasonable rudeness.... And Yelena wept
more and more....</p>

<p>“Then Gavrilo began to drink and carouse and
his usual abode became the dirty den, the ‘Crags’
on the bank, on the sand near the wharf.... This
was a small wooden house with a second floor, dark,
tilting to one side and propped up with beams.
You could see it from the bank; evenings there
were usually two lighted windows and the open
door, cymbals clashed, and there was a lot of
fiddling to amuse the guests.... From time to
time, you could hear confused shouts—both songs
and quarrels and calls for the police. It was an
eternally restless place and rather threatening.
The very antithesis of the drowsy country life....
Bargemen from our modest and usually idle wharf,
workmen from the brickyards like moles which had
burrowed in the damp clay, professional beggars
... in a word, the homeless, unfortunate, dissipated,
and evil. Even the decent members of the
proletariat shunned this place. And that’s where
Rogov took Gavrilo. And Yelena was the next to<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_140" id="Page_140">[140]</a></span>
learn the road to the ‘Crags’ so as to bring her
husband home....</p>

<p>“She did this surprisingly modestly, quietly, yes,
even beautifully. Once I was coming home from
my lessons and as I entered the gate I saw Yelena
running toward me and fastening a kerchief on
her head.</p>

<p>“‘Where are you going, Yelena?’</p>

<p>“A moment’s hesitation.</p>

<p>“‘You haven’t seen Gavrilo Stepanich go this
way, have you?’ she asked.</p>

<p>“‘He must have.... But you shouldn’t go
there, Yelena.’</p>

<p>“I wanted to stop her.... But she swept past
me angrily and with some apparent pride went
to look for Gavrilo Stepanich, her husband, and
she was his lawful wife.... In a half-hour I saw
her bringing Gavrilo Stepanich by the arm. He
was leaning on her but walking and looking straight
ahead with dull, faded and perplexed eyes. But
he was walking. By the gate he suddenly straightened
up, pushed away her hand and stared at her....
His face was dark, but his faded eye had a
decided look....</p>

<p>“‘Who are you? Tell me who you are?...
Oh?’</p>

<p>“She stopped and dropped her hand in despair.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_141" id="Page_141">[141]</a></span>
I thought of that spring morning and their mutual
oaths: ‘Remember God, Gavrilo Stepanich!’ I
was terrified: he’ll forget right now, this very
minute, I thought.... Suddenly a spark of
knowledge flickered up in his foolish face and
he swallowed hard. He didn’t say a word but
went to his rooms silently.... She followed him
in terror, respectfully and humbly....</p>

<p>“So it went on: Rogov would beckon to Gavrilo,
and he’d go off and begin to carouse. This man
got enormous power over Gavrilo, and Yelena objected,
humbly, respectfully, timidly, but constantly.
She probably looked upon all this as a
punishment sent to her as an atonement for her
‘sin.’ She grew thin, her nice plumpness disappeared,
her eyes sank deeper in her head.... But
when I looked at them I never could decide to
call them stupid. Her suffering was always wonderfully
intelligent like that of a bird.... She’d
go to the saloons after her drunken husband, every
one would laugh at her on the street, and make
rough jokes about her.... She felt no shame for
herself.... Only once she whispered: ‘That’s not
right, Gavrilo Stepanich, people are looking at
you....’</p>

<p>“One time when she was taking him back from
the ‘Crags,’ he broke away from her, ran up to<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_142" id="Page_142">[142]</a></span>
Budnikov’s door and began to kick it wildly.
Yelena almost dropped, and, as if she did not have
the strength to go after him, she watched him like
a man with the nightmare, who sees coming at
him something terrible which he has been expecting
but he can’t struggle against it.... The door
suddenly opened and M. Budnikov appeared....
Calm and haughty with an air of absolute superiority.
To tell you the truth, I was somewhat surprised....
Anyway, it was a delicate situation.
I didn’t know the details at the time, but I felt
there was something wrong and mistaken....
Suddenly clearness of vision, quiet, calm. And it
wasn’t put on. No,—that was easy to see....
It was merely absolute imperturbability.</p>

<p>“‘What do you want, Gavrilo?’ he said. ‘What
are you kicking for? Don’t you know how to
ring?... You see, here’s the bell....’</p>

<p>“He pointed to the bell handle. Gavrilo looked
at it and became confused. Yes, there was a knob
and there was really no reason to kick.... M.
Budnikov continued from the top step:</p>

<p>“‘Anyway, what are you thinking about and
what do you want of me, you r-rascal? Have I
insulted you, dealt unjustly with you, held up your
pay for even one day? Yet you kicked.... All
right, here I am.... What do you want?’</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_143" id="Page_143">[143]</a></span></p>

<p>“Gavrilo didn’t say a word....</p>

<p>“‘Well, then, I’ll tell you a thing or two myself:
the shovel’s broken again, the walk isn’t swept, the
horse hasn’t been watered.... The horse is a
dumb animal and can’t talk ... but just the same
it’s alive and feels.... Hear it whinney?...’</p>

<p>“This argument so overwhelmed Gavrilo that
he turned, thoroughly and definitely crushed, and
went straight to the stable. In a minute, just as
if he were sober, he took the horse to the trough....
M. Budnikov quietly locked his door and came
out. As he came past my wall he guessed that I
had seen the whole affair, stopped, and with a sad
shake of his head, remarked:</p>

<p>“‘Yes, every one’s talking of the people, the
people.... How do they fall in love with
them?...’”</p>

<h4>VIII</h4>

<p>“The scandal began to attract attention. It was
talked about in the city. Various opinions were
held. Some defended Budnikov. Was it worth
while to believe mere rumors? Really no one knew
anything. Some were stupid stories; others, evident
scandals and an unseemly breaking of the general
quiet.... But there was another side. People of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_144" id="Page_144">[144]</a></span>
the lower classes sympathized with Gavrilo. They
thought that the wise and strong M. Budnikov
must have filched from Gavrilo some sort of a
talisman and was now committing sorcery so that
the talisman would lose its power.... So dozens
of eyes were turned to the windows of M. Budnikov
and looked at him as he passed, stubbornly and
calmly, apparently unaware of the cloud of misunderstanding,
suspicion, condemnation, question,
... yes, sin, which trailed after him. Every look
expressed an evil thought and every heart was
heating with an evil feeling.... It was a peculiar
sort of dark cloud.... Hundreds of individual
spiritual movements, confused, unclear, but evil....
And all aimed at one centre....</p>

<p>“I must say Budnikov had been rather popular
and enjoyed the respect of all.... Even Rogov,
when he happened to pass our yard and saw M.
Budnikov with a shovel or rake, always stopped
and said:</p>

<p>“‘M. Budnikov, Semen Nikolayevich, is working....
He who works shall eat.’</p>

<p>“Or:</p>

<p>“‘M. Budnikov is helping his neighbor, the
porter, with the work of his hands. Most laudable!’</p>

<p>“Then he passed on as by an object to which he<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_145" id="Page_145">[145]</a></span>
was indifferent or at which he was pleasantly
amused.</p>

<p>“Now, that was all changed.... It gave me a
physical sensation ... like a nightmare. As if
those two lines ... or something in the character
of M. Budnikov had polluted the atmosphere....
It was almost an hallucination.... You’re going
to or from the gymnasium ... thinking out your
remarks.... You suddenly feel that M. Budnikov
is following you with his measured tread and his
self-satisfaction that comes from a consciousness
of duty performed.... Or you’re giving a lesson
or reading necessary notices and you absolutely
hear Budnikov’s accents in your own voice ...
when he lays down to a beggar rules for work or
preaches a moral to Gavrilo over the broken shovel
or advises me: ‘Lay aside pride and be
humble.’ ...</p>

<p>“In this ordinary thing, this humble and apparently
quiet life of peaceful corners, there’s
something terrible, ... specific, so to speak, not
easily noticeable, gray.... Really where are the
rascals, sacrifices, the right, the wrong?... You
so want the fog to be pierced by even one ray of
living, absolute truth, which will not be founded on
pencil lines, but will be actually able to solve the
riddle absolutely and completely ... the real<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_146" id="Page_146">[146]</a></span>
truth, which even Rogov will acknowledge....
Do you understand?</p>

<p>“‘I think I do,’ said the gentleman in the glasses
seriously.</p>

<p>“Apparently M. Budnikov began to feel that
something was wrong. He cleaned up but, as often
happens, he didn’t find the real question.... He
came to me once on the usual day, the twentieth.
You understand I gave him tea as usual.... He
drank it as usual, but his expression was different.
Sad and solemn. He finished his business, carefully
put away the money in his pocketbook,
marked it down, but didn’t leave.... He began to
talk round the bush ... about the abnormality of
his life, ... in particular about his loneliness,
some mistake caused by prejudice and pride....
Then he got talking of Yelena and Gavrilo. Gavrilo
had turned out to be utterly worthless and Yelena
had made a mistake and was very unhappy....
He felt responsible for letting her marry, but it was
hard to correct it.... It was harder still to fix
it up with money.... What good is money in
the hands of a drunkard? And so on. All these
subterfuges showed me that M. Budnikov wanted
to solve the whole riddle by recreating the original
situation, so to speak,—that is, to divorce Yelena
from Gavrilo and marry her himself.... That<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_147" id="Page_147">[147]</a></span>
meant those two lines would be wiped out and
disappear.... Apparently ... he had already
talked of this with several people, among them
Father Nikolay.... Now he wanted my advice....</p>

<p>“‘Have you spoken to Yelena about this?’ I
asked.</p>

<p>“‘No, not yet.... I, perhaps, you may notice,
don’t even go to see her, so as not to make trouble....
But I know what she needs.... I have no
reason to doubt....’</p>

<p>“I tried to advance certain points, but M. Budnikov
wouldn’t listen.... He soon said good-by
and left.... As if he feared for the integrity of
his whole plan of action....</p>

<p>“A little while after, when Gavrilo was away,
some women of the parish began to bob up at
Yelena’s and Budnikov received members of the
consistory. Twice, toward evening, I saw Rogov
leave Budnikov’s.... Then I thought: so that’s
what my young fellow is after; I see now why
he’s ruining Gavrilo; he’s fixing it so M. Budnikov
can arrange the divorce....</p>

<p>“The whole situation seemed to me so disgraceful
and hopeless that I began to think of moving and
simply getting away from the whole thing.... I
couldn’t sleep.... Again I began to walk around
the garden. Once I found Yelena in it.... She<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_148" id="Page_148">[148]</a></span>
was lying on that same bench where I sat that
spring morning.... It was fall now.... Everything
was dying and growing bare.... Autumn,
you know, is a terrible cynic. The wind breaks off
the leaves and laughs. They were lying on the
muddy, damp earth. And a woman was lying on
the damp bench with her face down and crying.
Yes, she was crying bitterly.... Later I found
out why: the arrangement of M. Budnikov was absolutely
impersonal. When she heard this proposition
she merely clasped her hands: ‘Let the earth
swallow me up, let me dry up like a chip.’ ... And
so on.... ‘You’d better bury me alive with Gavrilo
Stepanich.’ ... And Gavrilo Stepanich didn’t
spend the night at home. That former pure happiness
had perished and she didn’t know what to
do. A ticket ... two lines ... friends from the
church, Budnikov, Rogov. She was stupid and
obedient and afraid that something would be done
against her will....</p>

<p>“I walked up to her ... wanted to comfort
her. When I touched her and felt her body tremble
beneath my touch ... it seemed to me such a
stupid performance that I trembled, as if from
impotent pity....</p>

<p>“I went away.... I forgot the whole thing and
wanted to drop it and leave. If M. Budnikov<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_149" id="Page_149">[149]</a></span>
passed ... let him pass.... If Rogov was engaged
in dirty business, let him! If stupid Yelena
wanted a drunken husband, let her have one....
What did I care? What difference did it make who
got the ticket with the two lines, to whom those
stupid lines gave rights?... Everything was incomplete,
accidental, disconnected, senseless and
disgusting....”</p>

<h4>IX</h4>

<p>Pavel Semenovich stopped and looked out of the
window as if he had forgotten the story....</p>

<p>“Well, how did it end?” asked our new companion
cautiously.</p>

<p>“End?” The narrator woke up. “Of course,
everything on the earth ends some way. This ended
stupidly and simply. One night ... my bell rang.
Sharply, anxiously, nervously.... I jumped up
in fright, put on my slippers ... went out on the
steps ... there was no one there. But it occurred
to me that Rogov was around the corner. I thought
he must have been passing drunk and ugly and
wanted to annoy me by coming at this time....
He remembered that I was asleep and he, Vanichka
Rogov, my favorite pupil, was drunk on the street
and wanted to inform me of it. I closed the door,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_150" id="Page_150">[150]</a></span>
went back to bed, and fell asleep. The bell rang
again. I didn’t get up. Let him ring.... It
rang again and again.... No, this must be something
else. I put on my overcoat.... Opened the
door. There stood the night watchman. His beard
was covered with frost. ‘Please,’ he said.</p>

<p>“‘Where do you want me to go, brother?’ I
asked.</p>

<p>“‘To Semen Nikolayevich, M. Budnikov....
They’ve had ... trouble....’</p>

<p>“Without understanding anything, I dressed
mechanically and went. A clear cold night, and
late.... There were lights in the windows of M.
Budnikov, whistles along the street.... What a
stir for night.... I went up the steps and entered.
The first thing that caught my eye was the face
of Semen Nikolayevich, M. Budnikov.... Absolutely
different, not at all like what he was before.
He was lying on his pillow and looking somewhere
into space.... That was so strange.... I stopped
at the door and thought: ‘What’s this? I used
to know him but he’s suddenly changed.... This
isn’t the man who came once a month and drank
two glasses of tea. Who worried over Yelena’s
divorce, but it’s some one with other thoughts. He
lay immovable, important, but he didn’t look at us
or any one, and he seemed so different.... He<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_151" id="Page_151">[151]</a></span>
was afraid of no one and judged every one; himself,
that is, the old Semen Nikolayevich, and Gavrilo,
Yelena, Rogov, and ... yes, me too.... I suddenly
understood....</p>

<p>“Then I saw Gavrilo. By the window, in a
corner, grieved but quiet.... As I suddenly
understood, I walked up to him and said:</p>

<p>“‘Did you do this?’</p>

<p>“‘Of course, Pavel Semenovich, I did.’</p>

<p>“‘Why?’</p>

<p>“‘I don’t know, Pavel Semenovich....’</p>

<p>“Then the doctor attracted my attention. He
told me that there was no help.... People kept
walking and driving up, coming in, sitting down,
and writing statements.... It seemed so strange
that the young prosecutor, such a careful and reliable
man, should give orders not to let Gavrilo and
Yelena go and to hold some sort of an investigation....
I remember his smile when I asked him the
reason for it.... I’ll admit it was a strange question
but I thought that this procedure was unnecessary....
When they started to take Gavrilo
and Yelena away I involuntarily got up and asked
if they were going to take me.... I later heard
rumors that something was wrong with me. That
was false. My head was never so clear.... The
prosecutor was surprised. ‘If I may give you advice,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_152" id="Page_152">[152]</a></span>
you need to drink some water and go to bed.’
‘But Yelena?’ I asked; ‘why her?’ ‘We will hope,’
he answered, ‘that everything will turn out in a
way that’s best for her, but now ... at the first
inquiry ... it is my painful duty.’ ... I still
thought he was acting wrongly....</p>

<p>“The two were taken away. I went back to my
rooms and sat down on the steps. It was cold....
A clear, autumn, quiet night with a clear, white
frost.... The stars were sparkling and whispering
in the sky. They had such a special expression
and meaning.... You could hear their mysterious
whisper, though you couldn’t make out
what they said.... It was both a distant tremor
of alarm and also quiet and neighborly sympathy.</p>

<p>“I really wasn’t surprised when Rogov came up
quietly and timidly sat down beside me on the
steps. He sat a long time without saying a word....
I don’t remember whether he did say anything,
but I knew the whole story.... He had no
thoughts of murder. He wanted ‘to win Yelena’s
case with M. Budnikov’ for himself. He had to
get hold of the ticket, on which, as he supposed,
was an endorsement.... This clever scheme
pleased him: to get hold by illegal means of the
proof of a legal right. He saw something humorous
in it. The illegal procuring of legal proof in the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_153" id="Page_153">[153]</a></span>
form of a hypothetical endorsement.... That’s
why he worked his way into Budnikov’s confidence
through the business of the divorce.... He found
out everything about the place and sent one of
his obedient clients from the ‘Crags’ to take the
proper box. Gavrilo was to open the door of
M. Budnikov’s apartment with a second key, which
Budnikov, through strange oversight, had failed to
take back from him. Instead of waiting at the
door, Gavrilo had gone upstairs. I could have
sworn I had seen him walk along with his heavy
tread, his dark head, and the deep hatred in his
soul.... And how he reached the door and how
M. Budnikov awoke and apparently was not even
frightened but suddenly understood the whole
situation.</p>

<p>“I still saw that moment in the past, when two
students ran into my rooms on just such a bright
night, and I faced them in my shame and weakness....
What a fire ... evil and sarcastic ...
was blazing in the eyes of one....</p>

<p>“It seemed to me that I had discovered that
which was the bond of union among all things:
these lofty, flashing stars, the living murmur of the
wind among the branches, my memories, and this
deed.... When I was young I had often had this
sensation.... When my fresh mind was trying to<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_154" id="Page_154">[154]</a></span>
solve all questions and gain a larger truth. Another
time you will seem to be right at the threshold
and everything is about to be cleared up, when it
all vanishes.</p>

<p>“We sat a long time. Finally Rogov got up.</p>

<p>“‘Where are you going now?’ I asked.</p>

<p>“‘I don’t know,’ was the answer, ‘what I must
do.... I think I’ll have to join Gavrilo and
Yelena....’</p>

<p>“There he stood. I understood so much more
clearly than usual, and I suddenly realized that he
was waiting for me to shake hands. I held out
my hand and he suddenly seized it, and it was a
long time before he let it go....</p>

<p>“He broke away and left ... straight down the
street. I looked after him, as long as I could make
out the slender figure of my former pupil....”</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>For some time the silence in the compartment
was interrupted only by the rattling of the train
and a long whistle. The door slammed, and a
conductor walked along the corridor and called
out:</p>

<p>“Station of N-sk. Ten minutes’ wait.”</p>

<p>Pavel Semenovich hurriedly got up, picked up
a small valise, and, with a sad smile at his audience,
he got out of the train. I began to make preparations<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_155" id="Page_155">[155]</a></span>
to leave and so did the gentleman in the gold
glasses. Petr Petrovich remained alone. He looked
after Pavel Semenovich and, when the door was
shut behind him, he smiled at the gentleman in the
gold glasses, shook his head, and, running his finger
around his forehead, he said:</p>

<p>“He always was a crank.... Now I think he’s
not all there. I’ve heard that he threw up his
position and now goes around and gives private
lessons.”</p>

<p>The gentleman in the gold glasses looked steadily
at him but said nothing.</p>

<p>We got out of the train.</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>From the point of view of a reporter the case
was uninteresting. The jurors acquitted Gavrilo
(Yelena was not tried); Rogov was convicted of
being the instigator, but mercy was recommended.
The judge several times had to stop the witness
Pavel Semenovich Padorin, former teacher, who
constantly wandered away from facts, in order to
express opinions which were irrelevant and had
nothing to do with the case....</p>

<h3>“NECESSITY”</h3>

<p class="center">(AN EASTERN TALE)</p>

<h4>I</h4>

<p class="dropcap">One day, when the three good sages,—Ulaya,
Darnu, and Purana,—were sitting at the door
of their common home, young Kassapa, the son of
the Rajah Lichava, came up to them and sat down
on the earth which was piled around the house
but he did not speak. The young man’s cheeks were
pale and his eyes, which had lost the glow of youth,
seemed weary.</p>

<p>The old men looked one at another, and good
Ulaya said:</p>

<p>“Listen, Kassapa, tell to us, the three sages,
who wish you nothing but good, what is oppressing
your soul. Ever since you lay in the cradle, fate
has showered its gifts upon you and you look as
downcast as the meanest slave of your father, poor
Jebaka, who yesterday felt the heavy hand of your
steward....”</p>

<p>“Yes, poor Jebaka showed us the welts on his
back,” said stern Darnu and kindly Purana added:</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_160" id="Page_160">[160]</a></span></p>

<p>“We wished to call them to your attention, good
Kassapa.”</p>

<p>The young man did not allow him to finish. He
jumped up from his seat and exclaimed with an
impatience which he had never before displayed:</p>

<p>“Stop, kindly sages, with your sly reproaches!
You seem to think that I must give you account
for every welt inflicted by the steward on the back
of the slave Jebaka. I greatly doubt whether I
am bound to give account even of my own acts.”</p>

<p>The sages glanced again one at another and
Ulaya said:</p>

<p>“Continue, my son, if you so desire.”</p>

<p>“Desire?” interrupted the young man with a
bitter laugh. “The fact is, I don’t know whether
I desire anything or not. And whether I like what
I wish or what another wishes for me.”</p>

<p>He stopped. It was almost perfectly quiet but
a breeze stirred the tops of the trees, and a leaf
fell at the feet of Purana. While the sad gaze of
Kassapa was directed upon this, a stone broke off
from the heated cliff and rolled down to the bank of
a brook, where a large lizard was resting at this
moment.... Every day at the same hour it
crawled to this spot. Straightening its front legs
and closing its protruding eyes, it apparently
listened to the discourse of the sages. It was easy<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_161" id="Page_161">[161]</a></span>
to imagine that its green body contained the soul
of some wise Brahmin. But this day that stone
released this soul from its green envelope, so that
it might enter upon new transformations....</p>

<p>A bitter smile spread over Kassapa’s face.</p>

<p>“Come now, ye kindly sages,” he said, “ask this
leaf, if it wished to fall from the tree, or the stone,
if it wished to break off from the cliff, or the lizard,
if it wished to be crushed by the stone. The hour
came, the leaf fell, the lizard heard the last of
your conversations. For all that we know could not
be otherwise. Or do ye say that it should and could
have been otherwise than it was?”</p>

<p>“It could not,” answered the sages. “What has
been had to be in the great chain of events.”</p>

<p>“Ye have spoken. Therefore, the welts on the
back of Jebaka had to be in the great chain of
events, and every one of them has been written
since eternity in the book of necessity. And you
wish me, the same kind of a stone, the same kind
of a lizard, the same kind of a leaf on the great tree
of life, the same kind of an insignificant stream as
this brook which is driven by an unknown power
from source to mouth.... You wish me to struggle
against the current which is carrying me onward....”</p>

<p>He kicked the bloody stone which fell into the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_162" id="Page_162">[162]</a></span>
water and he again sank back on the earth beside
the good sages. The eyes of Kassapa again became
dull and sad.</p>

<p>Old Darnu said nothing; old Purana shook his
head; but the cheerful Ulaya merely laughed and
said:</p>

<p>“In the book of necessity, it is also manifestly
written, Kassapa, that I should tell to you what
happened once to the two sages, Darnu and Purana,
whom you see before you.... And in the same
book it is written that you shall listen to the tale.”</p>

<p>Then he told the following strange story about
his companions and they listened smilingly, but
neither confirmed or denied a word.</p>

<h4>II</h4>

<p>“In the land,” he said, “where blooms the lotus
and the sacred stream flows upon its course,—there
were no Brahmins more wise than Darnu and Purana.
No one had learned the Shastras better and
no one had dipped more deeply into the ancient
wisdom of the Vedas. But when both approached
the end of the mortal span of life and the storms of
approaching winter had touched their hair with
snow, both were still dissatisfied. The years were
passing, the grave was coming nearer and nearer,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_163" id="Page_163">[163]</a></span>
and truth seemed to recede further and
further....”</p>

<p>Both then, well aware that it was impossible to
escape the grave, decided to draw truth nearer to
themselves. Darnu was the first to put on a wanderer’s
robe, to hang a gourd of water on his belt,
to take a staff in his hand and to set out. After
two years of difficult traveling, he came to the foot
of a lofty mountain and on one of its peaks, at an
altitude where the clouds love to pass the night,
he saw the ruins of a temple. In a meadow near
the road shepherds were watching their flocks, and
Darnu asked them what sort of a temple it was,
what people had built it, and to what god they had
offered sacrifices.</p>

<p>The shepherds merely looked at the mountain
and then at Darnu, their questioner, for they did
not know what answer to make. Finally they said:</p>

<p>“We inhabitants of the valleys, do not know
how to answer you. There is among our number
an old shepherd Anuruja, who ages ago used to
pasture his flocks on these heights. He may know.”</p>

<p>They called this old man.</p>

<p>“I cannot tell you,” he said, “what people built
it, when they did it, and to what god they here
sacrificed. But my father heard from his father
and told me that my great grandfather had said<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_164" id="Page_164">[164]</a></span>
that there once lived a tribe of sages on the slopes
of these mountains and that they have all perished,
since they have erected this temple. The name of
the deity was ‘Necessity.’”</p>

<p>“Necessity?” exclaimed Darnu, greatly interested.
“Don’t you know, good father, what form
this deity had and whether or not it still resides in
this temple?”</p>

<p>“We are simple people,” answered the old man,
“and it is hard for us to answer your wise questions.
When I was young,—and that was years
and years ago,—I used to pasture my flock on these
mountain sides. At that time there stood in the
temple an idol wrought out of a gleaming black
stone. At rare intervals, when a storm overtook
me in the vicinity,—and storms are very terrible
among these crags,—I used to drive my flock into
the old temple for shelter. Rarely, too, Angapali,
a shepherdess from a neighboring hillside, would
run in, trembling and frightened. I warmed her
in my arms and the old god looked down at us
with a strange smile. But he never did us any
evil, perchance because Angapali always adorned
him with flowers. But they say....”</p>

<p>The shepherd stopped with a doubtful look at
Darnu and was apparently ashamed to tell him
more.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_165" id="Page_165">[165]</a></span></p>

<p>“Say what? My good man, tell me the whole
story,” requested the sage.</p>

<p>“They say, all the worshippers of the old god
have not perished.... Some are wandering
around the world.... And, sometimes, of course
rarely, they come here and ask like you the road to
the temple and they go there to question the old
god. These he turns to stone. Old men have often
seen in the temple columns or statues in the form of
seated men, richly covered with morning-glories
and other vines. Birds have built their nests on
some. Later on they gradually turn to dust.”</p>

<p>Darnu pondered deeply over the story. “Am I
now near the goal?” he thought. For it is well
known that “he, who like a blind man sees naught,
like a deaf man, hears naught, like a tree is immovable
and insensible, has attained unto rest and
knowledge.”</p>

<p>He turned to the shepherd.</p>

<p>“My friend, where is the road to the temple?”</p>

<p>The shepherd pointed it out, and when Darnu
commenced to ascend the overgrown path, he
watched the sage a long time and then said to his
young companions:</p>

<p>“Call me not the oldest of shepherds, but the
youngest of suckling lambs if the old god is not
soon going to have a new sacrifice. Yoke me like<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_166" id="Page_166">[166]</a></span>
an ox or burden me like an ass with various loads,
if another stone column is not to take its place in
the old temple!...”</p>

<p>The shepherds respectfully hearkened to the old
man and scattered over the pasture. And once
more the herds grazed peacefully in the valley, the
ploughman followed his plough, the sun shone,
night fell, and men were occupied with their own
cares and thought no more of wise Darnu. Soon,—in
a few days or so,—another wanderer came to
the foot of the mountain and he, too, asked about
the temple. When he followed the directions of
the shepherd and began to ascend the mountain
cheerfully, the old man shook his head and said:</p>

<p>“There goes another.”</p>

<p>This was Purana, following in the steps of wise
Darnu and thinking:</p>

<p>“It will never be said that Darnu found truth
which Purana could not seek.”</p>

<h4>III</h4>

<p>Darnu ascended the mountain.</p>

<p>It was a hard climb. It was very evident that a
human foot rarely passed over the neglected path,
but Darnu cheerfully defied all obstacles and finally
reached the half-ruined gates, above which was the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_167" id="Page_167">[167]</a></span>
ancient inscription: “I am Necessity, the mistress
of every movement.” The walls had no other
sculptures or decorations save fragments of some
numbers and mysterious calculations.</p>

<p>Darnu entered the sanctuary. The old walls
spread abroad the peace of destruction and death.
But this destruction apparently had grown weary
and left undisturbed the ruins of walls which had
witnessed the march of centuries. In one wall there
was a broad recess; several steps led up to an altar,
on which was an idol of a gleaming black stone;
the deity smiled strangely as it gazed upon this
picture of ruin. From beneath it bubbled a brook
which filled the wondrous silence with the murmur
of its water. Several palms stretched their roots
into its course and towered up to the blue sky,
which freely looked down through the ruined
roof....</p>

<p>Darnu involuntarily submitted to the wondrous
spell of this place and decided to question the mysterious
deity, whose spirit still seemed to fill the
ruined temple. The sage scooped up some water
out of the cold brook and gathered some fruit which
an old fig-tree had shed and then he began his
preparations according to all the rules in the books
on contemplation. First of all he sat down facing
the idol, drew up his legs, and looked at the image<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_168" id="Page_168">[168]</a></span>
a long time, for he wanted to impress it upon his
mind. Then he bared his abdomen and gazed upon
that spot where he was bound to his mother before
his earthly birth. For it is well known that all
knowledge lies between being and not being and
hence must come the revelations of contemplation....</p>

<p>In such a posture he saw the end of the first day
and the beginning of the second. The heat of noon
several times replaced the cool of evening and the
shadows of night gave place to the light of the
sun,—but Darnu remained in the same position,
rarely plunging his gourd into the water or absent-mindedly
picking up some fruit. The eyes of
the sage grew dull and fixed; his limbs dried up.
At first he felt the inconvenience and pain of immobility.
Later on these sensations passed into
complete unconsciousness, and before the stony
gaze of the sage another world, the world of contemplation,
began to unroll its strange apparitions
and shapes. They no longer bore any relationship
to the experiences of the meditating sage. They
were disinterested, disconnected, and concerned
only themselves, and that meant that they were the
preludes to a revelation of the truth.</p>

<p>It was hard to say how long this state continued.
The water in the gourd dried up, the palms quietly<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_169" id="Page_169">[169]</a></span>
rustled, the ripening fruits broke off and fell at
the sage’s feet, but he let them lie on the ground.
He was almost freed from thirst and hunger. He
was not warmed by the noontide sun nor chilled
by the cool freshness of the night. Finally he
ceased to distinguish the light of day and the darkness
of night.</p>

<p>Then the inner eye of Darnu saw the long expected
vision. Out of his abdomen grew a green
trunk of bamboo tipped with a knot like an ordinary
stem. From the knot grew another section
and thus, rising ever higher, the trunk grew to
consist of fifty joints, a number corresponding to
the years of the sage. At the top, instead of leaves
and blossoms, grew a something resembling the
idol in the temple. This something looked down on
Darnu with an evil smile.</p>

<p>“Poor Darnu,” it said finally. “Why did you
come here and take so much trouble? What do you
want, poor Darnu?”</p>

<p>“I seek the truth,” answered the sage.</p>

<p>“Then look on me, for I am what you sought.
But I see that I am unpleasant and disagreeable to
your sight.”</p>

<p>“You are incomprehensible,” answered Darnu.</p>

<p>“Listen, Darnu. Do you see the fifty joints of
the reed?”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_170" id="Page_170">[170]</a></span></p>

<p>“The fifty joints of the reed are my years,” said
the sage.</p>

<p>“And I sit above them, for I am ‘Necessity,’ the
mistress of every movement. Every act, every
breath, everything existing, everything living is
impotent, powerless, helpless; under the control
of necessity it attains the aim of its existence, which
is death. I am that which has guided the fifty
joints of your life from the cradle to the present
moment. You have never done a single thing in
your whole life: not a single thing of good or
evil.... You have never given a coin to a beggar
in a moment of pity nor dealt a single blow with
hatred in your heart ... you have never cared
for a single rose in your monastery gardens nor
felled a single tree in the forest ... you have
never fed a single animal nor killed a single gnat
which was sucking your blood.... You have
never made a single movement in your whole life
without it being marked down in advance by
me.... Because I am Necessity.... You have
been proud of your actions or lamented bitterly for
your sins. Your heart trembled from love or hate,
but I—I was laughing at you, for I am Necessity
and write down everything in advance. When you
entered a square to teach fools what to do or what
to avoid,—I was laughing and saying to myself:<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_171" id="Page_171">[171]</a></span>
just see wise Darnu reveal his wisdom to those
naïve fools and share his sanctity with sinners.
Not because Darnu is wise and holy, but because I,
‘Necessity,’ am like a stream and Darnu is like a
leaf carried away by the current. Poor Darnu,
you thought that you had been led hither by your
search for truth.... But on these walls among
my calculations was marked the day and the hour
when you had to cross this threshold. Because I
am Necessity.... Poor sage!”</p>

<p>“I loathe you,” said the seer with aversion.</p>

<p>“I know it. Because you considered yourself
free and I am Necessity, the mistress of every
movement.”</p>

<p>Then Darnu became angry; he seized the fifty
joints of the reed, broke them off, and flung them
away. “So,” he said, “so will I deal with the fifty
joints of my life, because during these fifty years
I was merely the tool of Necessity. Now I will
free myself, because I have seen and I want to
break my yoke.”</p>

<p>But Necessity, invisible in the darkness which
surrounded the dull gaze of the sage, laughed and
repeated:</p>

<p>“No, poor Darnu, you are still mine, because I
am Necessity.”</p>

<p>Darnu opened his eyes with difficulty and suddenly<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_172" id="Page_172">[172]</a></span>
he felt that his feet were swollen and painful.
He started to rise, but at once he sank back
again. Because he now saw clearly the significance
of all the inscriptions and calculations in
the temple. As soon as he began to move his
limbs, he saw that his desire to do so had already
been written on the wall.</p>

<p>As from another world, the voice of Necessity
came to his ears:</p>

<p>“Rise now, poor Darnu; your limbs are swollen.
You see 999,998 of your brothers in darkness
do it.... It is <i>necessary</i>.”</p>

<p>In disgust Darnu remained in his former position,
which now became still more painful. But
he said to himself: “I will be one of those in the
darkness who will not submit to Necessity, because
I am free.”</p>

<p>Meanwhile the sun had reached the zenith, and
as it looked through the holes in the roof, it began
to parch the ill-protected body of the sage....
Darnu stretched out his hand toward his gourd.</p>

<p>But he at once saw what was written on the wall
under the number 999,998 and Necessity again
said:</p>

<p>“Poor sage, it is <i>necessary</i> that you drink.”</p>

<p>Darnu left the gourd untouched and said:</p>

<p>“I will not drink, because I am free.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_173" id="Page_173">[173]</a></span></p>

<p>There came a laugh from a distant corner of the
temple and at the same time one of the fruits of
the fig-tree grew too heavy to hang any longer and
fell at the feet of the sage. At the same time a
number on the wall changed. Darnu realized at
once that this was a new attempt of Necessity to
destroy his inner liberty.</p>

<p>“I will not eat,” he said, “because I am free.”</p>

<p>Again there came a laugh from the depths of
the temple and he heard the murmuring of the
brook:</p>

<p>“Poor Darnu!”</p>

<p>The sage became more angry. He remained motionless
without looking at the fruit which from
time to time fell from the boughs, without hearkening
to the seductive murmur of the waters, and
he kept repeating one phrase to himself: “I am
free, free, free!” And that no fruit might thwart
his freedom by falling directly into his mouth, he
closed it tightly and clenched his teeth.</p>

<p>Thus he sat for a long time, freeing himself from
hunger and thirst and trying to spread abroad to
all the corners of the earth confidence in his inner
liberty. He grew thin, dried up, became wooden,
lost track of time and space. He could no longer
distinguish day and night, but he kept repeating
and asserting to himself that he was free. After<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_174" id="Page_174">[174]</a></span>
a certain space of time, the birds became accustomed
to his immobility, flew up and perched
upon him, and still later a pair of wild doves built
their nest on the head of the free sage and heedlessly
brought forth their young in the folds of
his turban.</p>

<p>“O foolish birds!” thought wise Darnu, when
first the calling of the parents and the peeping of
the young penetrated his consciousness. “They do
all this because they are not free and obey the laws
of Necessity.” And even when his shoulders were
covered with the droppings of the birds,—he again
said to himself:</p>

<p>“Fools! They do <i>this</i> too, because they are not
free.”</p>

<p>He counted himself perfectly free and close to
the gods.</p>

<p>Below, out of the soil, the thin tendrils of
climbing vines began to rise and to wind themselves
around his immovable limbs....</p>

<h4>IV</h4>

<p>Only once was the wise Darnu partially recalled
from complete unconsciousness and at that time he
felt in some remote corner of his mind a sensation
of mild astonishment.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_175" id="Page_175">[175]</a></span></p>

<p>This was caused by the appearance of the sage
Purana. Exactly like Darnu he walked up
to the temple, read the inscription above the entrance,
and then going in, began to read the figures
on the walls. The wise Purana was very unlike
his stern companion. He was kindly and had a
round face. A cross-section of his trunk would
have formed a circle, his pleasant eyes sparkled,
and his lips wore a smile. In his wisdom he was
never obstinate like Darnu, and he sought blessed
peace far more zealously than he did freedom.</p>

<p>Walking around the temple, he came to the recess,
reverenced the deity, and then, with a glance
at the brook and the fig tree, he said:</p>

<p>“Here is a deity with a pleasant smile, and there
is a stream of fresh water and a fig-tree. What
more does a man need for pleasant contemplation?
Yes, and there’s Darnu. He is so blessed that the
birds are building their nests upon him....”</p>

<p>The appearance of his wise friend was not especially
joyous, but Purana, gazing at him reverently,
said to himself:</p>

<p>“There’s no doubt he’s blessed; but he always
loved too stern methods of contemplation. I do
not aspire to the higher stages of blessedness, but
I hope to tell the dwellers upon earth what I see
on the lower planes.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_176" id="Page_176">[176]</a></span></p>

<p>Then after enjoying the water and the juicy
fruit, he sat down comfortably not far from Darnu,
and he too prepared for contemplation in the
proper way: that is, by baring his abdomen and
gazing at it as the other sage had done.</p>

<p>So passed a time, more slowly than with Darnu,
for the kindly Purana often interrupted his contemplation
to enjoy the water and the juicy fruit.
Finally out of the navel of the second wise man
sprang a bamboo trunk and this attained a height
of fifty joints, the number of the years of his life.
On the top again sat “Necessity,” but in his semi-conscious
state she seemed to him to smile pleasantly
and he replied in the same way.</p>

<p>“Who are you, kind deity?” he asked.</p>

<p>“I am Necessity, who has governed the fifty
years of your life. All that you have done, you
did not do, but I did them, for you are but a leaf
swept along by the stream and I am the mistress
of every movement.”</p>

<p>“Blessed art thou,” said Purana. “I see that I
have not come to you in vain. Continue in the
future to execute your tasks for yourself and me
and I will watch for you in pleasant contemplation.”</p>

<p>He lost himself in sleep with a happy smile on
his lips. So he continued his pleasant contemplation,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_177" id="Page_177">[177]</a></span>
from time to time filling his gourd with water
or picking up fruit which had fallen to the ground
at his feet. Each time he stirred with less and
less pleasure, since the drowsiness of contemplation
was more and more strongly mastering him,
and since he had already eaten the fruit which was
nearest to him, he had to exert himself to obtain
them from the tree.</p>

<p>Finally he said to himself:</p>

<p>“I’m a foolish man far removed from truth, and
that’s why I have such foolish cares. Isn’t it because
this good deity is so slow with her revelations?
Here before me on the tree is ripe fruit
and my stomach is empty.... But doesn’t the
law of necessity say: ‘where there is an hungry
stomach and fruit, the latter must of necessity enter
the former’?... So, kind necessity, I submit
to your power.... Isn’t that the greatest blessedness?”</p>

<p>Thereupon he buried himself in complete contemplation
like Darnu, and he waited for necessity
to manifest herself. In order to facilitate her
task, he held his mouth open facing the fig tree....</p>

<p>He waited one day, two, three.... Gradually
the smile congealed upon his face, his body dried
up, the pleasant rotundity of his form disappeared,
the fat under his skin wasted away and the sinews<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_178" id="Page_178">[178]</a></span>
stood out distinctly through it. When at last the
fruit ripened and fell, striking Purana on the
nose,—the sage did not hear it fall nor did he feel
the blow.... Another pair of doves built a nest
in the folds of his turban, fledglings peeped soon
in the nest, and the shoulders of Purana were covered
thickly with the droppings of the birds.
When the luxurious vines had enveloped Purana,
it was impossible to distinguish him from his companion—the
obstinate sage struggling against Necessity
from the good-natured sage willingly submitting
to it.</p>

<p>Absolute silence reigned in the temple, and the
gleaming idol looked down on the two sages with
its enigmatic and strange smile.</p>

<p>Fruit ripened and fell from the trees, the brook
bubbled on, white clouds sailed across the blue sky
and looked down into the interior of the temple
and the sages sat on without manifesting any signs
of life—one in the blessedness of denial, the other
in the blessedness of submission to Necessity.</p>

<h4>V</h4>

<p>Eternal night had spread its black wings over
both and no living being would ever have known
the truth which the two sages had perceived at the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_179" id="Page_179">[179]</a></span>
summit of the fifty joints of the reed. But before
the last spark which illumined in the darkness the
consciousness of wise Darnu had been finally extinguished,—he
heard again the same voice as before:
Necessity was laughing in the gathering
darkness, and this laughter, taciturn and soundless,
seemed to Darnu a presentiment of
death....</p>

<p>“Poor Darnu,” said the implacable deity, “pitiable
sage! You thought you could leave me, you
hoped that you could lay aside my yoke and by
turning into an immobile column purchase thereby
the consciousness of spiritual liberty....”</p>

<p>“Yes, I am free,” answered the thought of the
obstinate sage. “I alone in the darkness of your
servants do not obey the commands of Necessity....”</p>

<p>“Look here, poor Darnu....”</p>

<p>Suddenly with his inner eye he saw again the
meaning of all the inscriptions and calculations on
the walls of the temple. The numbers quietly
changed, they grew or diminished automatically
and one of them especially attracted his attention.
It was the number 999,998.... And as he looked
at it, two units more fell on the wall and the long
number quietly began to change. Darnu trembled
and Necessity smiled again.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_180" id="Page_180">[180]</a></span></p>

<p>“You understood, poor sage? In every hundred
thousand of my blind servants there is always one
obstinate man like you, and one lazy man like Purana....
You have both come here.... Greetings,
ye sages, who have completed my calculations....”</p>

<p>Two tears rolled down from the dull eyes of the
sage; they quietly rolled down over his dried up
cheeks and fell upon the ground like two ripe
fruits from the tree of his aged wisdom.</p>

<p>Beyond the walls of the temple everything went
as usual. The sun shone, the winds blew, the people
in the valley busied themselves with their cares,
the clouds gathered in the heavens.... As they
crossed the mountains, they became heavy and
weak. A storm broke in the mountains....</p>

<p>Again as in times of yore, a foolish shepherd
from a neighboring hillside drove hither his flock
and from another direction a young and foolish
shepherdess drove hither her flock. They met by
the brook and the recess out of which the deity
looked at them with its strange smile, and while the
thunder roared, they embraced and cooed, just as
999,999 pairs had done in the same situation. If
wise Darnu could have seen and heard them, he
would certainly have said in the greatness of his
wisdom:</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_181" id="Page_181">[181]</a></span></p>

<p>“Fools, they are doing this not for themselves
but for the pleasure of Necessity.”</p>

<p>The storm passed, the sun again played upon the
grass, which was still covered with the sparkling
drops of rain and lighted up the darkened interior
of the temple.</p>

<p>“Look,” said the shepherdess, “see those two
new statues. They never were here before.”</p>

<p>“Hush,” answered the shepherd. “Old men
say that these are worshippers of the ancient deity.
But they can’t do any harm.... Stay with them
and I’ll go and find your stray sheep.”</p>

<p>He went out and left her alone with the idol
and the two sages. Because she was a little afraid
and because she was filled with youthful love and
delight, she could not remain in one place but kept
walking around the temple and singing loud songs
of love and joy. When the storm was entirely
passed and the edge of the dark cloud had hidden
itself behind the distant summits of the range of
mountains, she pulled some damp flowers and
decked the idol with them. To conceal its unpleasant
smile, she stuck in its mouth a fruit of the
mountain nut with its leaves and stem.</p>

<p>Then she looked at it and laughed aloud.</p>

<p>That did not seem enough. She wanted to
adorn the old men with flowers. But since good<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_182" id="Page_182">[182]</a></span>
Purana still carried the nest with the young birds,
she turned her attention to stern Darnu, whose
nest had been abandoned. She removed the empty
nest, cleaned of bird droppings the turban, hair
and shoulders of the sage and washed his face with
spring water. She thought that in this way she
was recompensing the gods for their protection of
her happiness. Because even this seemed little and
she was overflowing with joy, she bent over and
suddenly the blessed Darnu, standing on the very
threshold of Nirvana, felt on his dry lips the vigorous
kiss of the foolish girl....</p>

<p>Soon after the shepherd returned with a lamb
which he had found, and the two went off, singing a
cheerful song.</p>

<h4>VI</h4>

<p>In the meantime, that spark which had not been
quite extinguished in the consciousness of wise
Darnu, flickered up and commenced to burn
brighter and brighter. First of all, in him as in a
house where everyone is sleeping, thought awoke
and began to wander restlessly in the darkness.
Wise Darnu thought a whole hour and formed only
one phrase:</p>

<p>“They were subject to Necessity....”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_183" id="Page_183">[183]</a></span></p>

<p>Another hour:</p>

<p>“But in the last instance, I too was subject to
it....”</p>

<p>A third hour brought a new premise:</p>

<p>“In picking the fruit, I obeyed the law of Necessity.”</p>

<p>A fourth:</p>

<p>“But in refusing, I fulfilled her calculations.”</p>

<p>A fifth:</p>

<p>“Those fools live and love, but wise Purana and
I die.”</p>

<p>A sixth:</p>

<p>“This perhaps is a work of Necessity, but it has
very little sense.”</p>

<p>Then awakened thought finally stirred itself and
began to rouse other sleeping faculties:</p>

<p>“If Purana and I die,” said wise Darnu to himself,
“it will be inevitable but foolish. If I succeed
in saving myself and my companion, it will
be likewise necessary but sensible. Therefore we
will save ourselves. For this I need will and
strength.”</p>

<p>He rallied the little spark of will which had not
been extinguished. He compelled it to raise his
heavy eyelids.</p>

<p>The daylight broke in upon his consciousness, as
it floods a room on the opening of the shutters.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_184" id="Page_184">[184]</a></span>
First he noticed the lifeless figure of his friend,
with his set face and the tear that precedes death
already on his cheeks. Darnu’s heart felt such
pity for his ill-fated fellow seeker after truth that
his will became stronger and stronger. It entered
his hands and they began to move; his hands helped
his feet.... This all took much longer to execute
than to decide upon. But the following morning
found Darnu’s gourd full of fresh water at Purana’s
lips, and a piece of juicy fruit fell finally into
the open mouth of the good-natured sage.</p>

<p>Then Purana’s jaws moved and he thought: “O
benevolent Necessity. I see that you are now beginning
to fulfill your promise.” But when he realized
that it was not the goddess but his companion
Darnu who was stirring around him, he felt himself
rather insulted and said:</p>

<p>“Eight mountain ranges and seven seas, the sun
and the holy gods, you, I, the universe,—all are
moved by Necessity.... Why did you awaken
me, Darnu? I was on the threshold of blessed
peace.”</p>

<p>“You were like a corpse, friend Purana.”</p>

<p>“He who like a blind man sees nought, like a
deaf man hears nought, like a tree is insensible
and immovable, has attained rest.... Give me
some more water to drink, friend Darnu....”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_185" id="Page_185">[185]</a></span></p>

<p>“Drink, Purana. I still see a tear on your cheek.
Did not the blessedness of peace press it from your
eyes?”</p>

<p>The wise sages spent the next three weeks in
accustoming their mouths to eating and drinking
and their limbs to moving, and during these three
weeks they slept in the temple and warmed each
other with the heat of their bodies till their strength
returned.</p>

<p>At the beginning of the fourth week, they stood
at the threshold of the ruined temple. Below at
their feet lay the green slopes of the mountain
descending into the valley.... Far in the distance
were the winding rivers, the white houses of
the villages and cities where people lived their normal
lives, busied with cares, passions, love, anger
and hate, where joy was changed for sorrow, and
sorrow was healed by new joy, and where amid
the roaring torrent of life men raised their eyes
to heaven, seeking a star to guide them.... The
sages stood and looked at the picture of life spread
out at the entrance to the old temple.</p>

<p>“Where shall we go, friend Darnu?” asked the
blinded Purana. “Are there no directions on the
walls of the temple?”</p>

<p>“Leave the temple and its deity in peace,” answered
Darnu. “If we go to the right, that will<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_186" id="Page_186">[186]</a></span>
be in accordance with Necessity. If we go to the
left, that too is in accordance with her. Don’t
you understand, friend Purana, that this deity
acknowledges as its laws everything that our choice
decides upon. Necessity is not the master but
merely the soulless accountant of our movements.
The accountant marks only what has been. What
must be—will be only by our will....”</p>

<p>“It means....”</p>

<p>“It means,—let us permit Necessity to worry
over her calculations, as she will. Let us choose
that path which leads us to the homes of our
brothers.”</p>

<p>With cheerful steps both sages went down from
the mountain heights into the valley, where human
life flows on amid cares, love, and sorrow, where
laughter echoes and tears flow....</p>

<p>“And where our steward, O Kassapa, covers the
back of the slave Jebaka with welts,” added wise
Darnu with a smile of reproach.</p>

<p>This is the story which the cheerful sage Ulaya
told to the young son of the Rajah Lichava, when
he had fallen into the idleness of despair....
Darnu and Purana smiled, denying nothing and
affirming nothing, and Kassapa heard the story.
Buried in thought he went away toward the home
of his father, the powerful Rajah Lichava.</p>

<h3>ON THE VOLGA</h3>

<h4>I</h4>

<p class="dropcap">As he went out on the deck of the steamer
which was running upstream, Dmitry Parfentyevich
drew a deep breath.</p>

<p>The day was ending and the sun was hanging
low above the forest-covered mountain. The river
furnished a majestic and peaceful picture. Somewhere
in the distance a steamboat whistled; a sailboat
heavily laden lay on the river and seemed as
immobile as the sleepy wife of a merchant. The
rafts all carried fires,—the men were cooking their
dinners. Two small barks, fastened together and
heading obliquely across stream, floated by, hardly
touching the glassy surface of the river, and beneath
them, swinging and swaying, hung their reflection
in the blue depths. When the wake of the
steamer, spreading ever wider and wider, touched
this image, it suddenly broke and scattered. It
was a sudden shattering of a mirror and the fragments
floated and sparkled for a long time.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_190" id="Page_190">[190]</a></span></p>

<p>“Are you all right, Grunya?” asked Dmitry
Parfentyevich, sitting down beside his daughter.</p>

<p>“Yes,” she answered briefly.</p>

<p>The girl wore a dark dress. A Scythian kerchief
on her forehead threw a shadow over her pale
young face; her large eyes were dreamy and
thoughtful.</p>

<p>“The main thing is heavenly blessing and quiet,”
moralized Dmitry Parfentyevich.</p>

<p>His life was moving toward its close and he
thought that nothing could be better than the quiet
of a dying day....</p>

<p>Only quiet and prayer after sinful vanity and
weakness.... May God grant no new wishes,
but save from every new temptation.</p>

<p>“Grunya?” Dmitry Parfentyevich looked at his
daughter and he wished to ask about her own
thoughts.</p>

<p>“Yes,” answered the girl, but her gaze, dreamily
running far ahead over the golden river and
the mountains with their quiet veil of bluish mist,
seemed to be seeking something else.</p>

<p>The passengers on the deck were just as quiet.
Some were carrying on private conversations;
others were getting ready for tea at the little
tables.</p>

<p>In the stern sat a group of Tatars, returning<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_191" id="Page_191">[191]</a></span>
home from Astrakhan. There was an old patriarch
with three sons. A fourth, the favorite, had
been buried in a strange city. Akhmetzyan had
been taken ill with an unknown disease, lay a week
and died.</p>

<p>“All is as Allah wills,” said the stern face of
the old man, but he had still to tell the mother of
the death of her beloved son.</p>

<p>Everything breathed of silence and peace and
the mountains on the right bank swam up one after
the other and then, receding into the distance, they
seemed to wrap themselves in a blue haze.</p>

<h4>II</h4>

<p>Near Dmitry Parfentyevich were the knots of
passengers, some on benches by the table, others
on the deck and sitting on bundles.</p>

<p>There were several raftsmen from Unzha, a fat
and good-natured country woman, and an old man,
probably also a small farmer. The centre of the
group at this moment was a steward for the third
class passengers. He was still young and was
dressed in a worn and dirty frock coat, with the
number “2” on the left side. A napkin hung over
his shoulder and with this he attained remarkable
success in rubbing the wet tables and the glasses.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_192" id="Page_192">[192]</a></span>
He had just brought to the deck a tray of dishes
with his arms wide open and with his eyes looking
ahead and at his feet at the same instant. He had
put the tray on the table, wiped off the dust around
it with his napkin, and then joining this group
of his countrymen sat down on the end of the
bench and at once assumed a leading rôle in the
conversation which they had already commenced.</p>

<p>“I’ll tell you,” he said in a wholly confident
tone, “if I cross myself with my fist, it works. This
way: in the Name of the Father and of the Son
and of the Holy Ghost, Amen. It really works just
the same. What do you think?”</p>

<p>He looked at the others with the air of a man
who had just propounded a very clever riddle.</p>

<p>“The fist, you say?” asked one of the peasants
from Unzha in surprise.</p>

<p>“Yes, the fist.”</p>

<p>The listeners shook their heads as a mark of doubt
and reproof. The farmer turned sternly to the
young fellow:</p>

<p>“N-now, stop that! You claim to be above
God....”</p>

<p>“What do you mean?”</p>

<p>“Why, you are a foo-fool to make the sign of
the cross with your fist. Impossible. It never
works.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_193" id="Page_193">[193]</a></span></p>

<p>“It does!”</p>

<p>The young fellow looked round upon his auditors
with a joyously radiant face and was about to give
the answer to the riddle when he heard at one of
the tables the impatient tapping of a spoon on a
glass.</p>

<p>The fellow jumped up as if he had been shot. In
an instant he was at the other end of the deck,
grabbed the tea-pots, ran to the machinery and
back, set the table, shook himself, ran below again,
put up the orders and passed them around the
tables, and all the while the conversation continued
before an enchanted audience.</p>

<p>“He’s beside himself!” said the farmer.</p>

<p>“Due to a stupid mind,” added the old woman
pityingly.</p>

<p>“The little fellow was a liar, that’s all!”</p>

<p>“How can you do it with your fist?... That
never works....”</p>

<p>The general opinion was evidently very definite.</p>

<p>“Impossible,” said several voices suddenly.
“It’s impudence and nothing else....”</p>

<p>“What——?”</p>

<p>“Where did you get that notion?”</p>

<p>“It’s impudence....”</p>

<p>“Just you listen,” interrupted the young waiter,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_194" id="Page_194">[194]</a></span>
suddenly coming up the hatch, “and you may not
think it impudent.... In the linen factory in
the place where I lived there was a fellow and a
machine caught all his fingers and slash bang!
That’s all! He didn’t have a finger left! And
his right hand too.... Just imagine: being a
man with nothing but his palm left....”</p>

<p>The audience was charmed.</p>

<p>“What are you driving at?”</p>

<p>“You see the question.... What would you do,
brothers?... Could he cross himself with his left
hand?...”</p>

<p>“What, what?” The farmer waved his hand.
“You can’t use the left hand.... That’s for
Satan....”</p>

<p>“But he’d lost the fingers on the right, so he
couldn’t join them.... Had only the palm
left!...”</p>

<p>“That’s so....”</p>

<p>The riddle became more popular. The passengers
nearby listened; those further off got up and
walked nearer to the speaker. Even the young
merchant who was talking very authoritatively
about politics at the tea table with a fat gentleman,
deigned to turn his benevolent attention to the all-ingrossing
riddle. He tapped with his spoon and
beckoned to the waiter.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_195" id="Page_195">[195]</a></span></p>

<p>“Waiter, how much?... O-oh! What did you
say: with the fist?”</p>

<p>“Yes, your excellency, among ourselves.... It
doesn’t interest you....”</p>

<p>“No, but it’s really clever, isn’t it?” remarked
the merchant to his fat friend.</p>

<p>The latter’s answer was unintelligible, for the
man was struggling with a slice of bread and
butter.</p>

<p>But the Tatars sat in the stern without taking
any part in the general conversation. They were
silent, but once in a while they made brief remarks
to one another in their own language.</p>

<h4>III</h4>

<p>Dmitry Parfentyevich started like a war horse
at the sound of a trumpet. Grunya did not take
her eyes from the distant mountains and the river,
but it was easy to see that she was not looking at
them. Without turning her head she was listening
intently to the conversation of her neighbors.</p>

<p>Dmitry Parfentyevich looked at her askance.
Hitherto she would have turned to him immediately
with a trusting question: “Papa, how’s
that?” Now she seemed to pay no attention to her
father’s opinion.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_196" id="Page_196">[196]</a></span></p>

<p>He waited for her to ask but her large eyes fell
with evident sympathy upon that knot of dark,
ignorant people, who were shocked by such a meaningless
change in their faith....</p>

<p>He rose and walked up to the disputants. His
thickset, dry figure, savagely pure, in an old-fashioned
costume, won for him the immediate attention
of all.</p>

<p>“What’s the trouble?” he asked.</p>

<p>“It’s this way, you see, merchant.... This
little fellow says you can cross yourself with your
fist.”</p>

<p>“I heard him but don’t repeat it! That man’s
a fool!”</p>

<p>“Yes, yes,” whispered one timidly, “we’re all
dark people....”</p>

<p>“That’s true, ... you are. If you follow the
teachings of your true masters, you’ll find nothing
surprising here.”</p>

<p>The audience grew rapidly larger. All were now
interested in the tall old man with quiet and
majestically austere manners. Dmitry Parfentyevich
was not embarrassed by the attention he was
receiving. It was not the first time. There was
only one person in that crowd that interested him
and that was his scholar, his disobedient and devout
Grunya. In his own way he loved his daughter and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_197" id="Page_197">[197]</a></span>
his rough heart was torn by her unwearied doubts
and her sad look. He passionately wished her to
feel that peace from heaven which his own heart
had so fully obtained. But her disobedience always
aroused in his stern soul a storm of suppressed
rage and this struggled with his love and usually
conquered it.</p>

<p>Grunya still kept her seat. She did not stir but
she listened intently.</p>

<p>“Now listen,” came to her ears the confident and
harsh voice of her father. “This is the true cross
and it is to this cross that we hold in order to be
saved.”</p>

<p>He raised his hand with two fingers raised, so
that all could see.</p>

<p>“A dissenter,” was the murmur in the crowd.
Two or three merchants who were apparently fond
of religious discussions, pressed nearer, when they
heard this unexpected confession.</p>

<p>“We are not dissenters,” continued Dmitry
Parfentyevich. “We confess the true faith. This
was the form of the cross which the holy fathers
and the patriarchs believed in. This was taught by
St. Theodoret.”</p>

<p>He raised his hand with the two fingers joined
still higher.</p>

<p>“Press the thumb against the little finger and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_198" id="Page_198">[198]</a></span>
the ring finger. That is to signify the Holy Trinity.
Three Persons united. Raise two fingers: that’s for
deity and humanity—two natures. Theodoret
teaches again that the middle finger is to be bent a
little. That symbolizes humanity reverencing
deity. See!”</p>

<p>“Wait!” interrupted one of the merchants who
had forced his way to the front. “St. Cyril says
something else.”</p>

<p>“St. Cyril says the same thing. Only he bids
you keep both fingers straight.”</p>

<p>“That must make a difference.”</p>

<p>“Wait, my good man, that’s wrong.... Don’t
interrupt....” The speakers stopped. “Let him
finish.... What about the fist, merchant?”</p>

<p>“Yes ... that’s the main thing.”</p>

<p>“It’s like this: if he lost his fingers he wasn’t
to blame. That means: God allowed it. It was His
will! But a man can’t live without making the
sign of the cross. Without the sign of the cross
he’s worse than this heathen Tatar. He’s bound to
cross himself ... with his right hand....”</p>

<p>“Well?”</p>

<p>“And his fingers,” concluded Dmitry Parfentyevich
after a pause: “His fingers he must place in
thought, as he is ordered by the holy fathers and
patriarchs....”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_199" id="Page_199">[199]</a></span></p>

<p>The crowd heaved a sigh of relief and joy.</p>

<p>“Merchant, we thank you!”</p>

<p>“He decided....”</p>

<p>“That’s it: he just chewed it up and explained
it.”</p>

<p>“With thought! That’s true!”</p>

<p>“Of course!... With thought, nothing else!”</p>

<p>“That will work all right....”</p>

<p>Dmitry Parfentyevich looked at his daughter....
What did he care for this applause, these
praises from strange, ignorant people! She, his
daughter, kept looking straight ahead with a look
of indifference upon her face, as if her father had
said something which she had long known and
which had lost all power to touch her confused and
weary soul....</p>

<p>The old man frowned and his voice became menacing.</p>

<p>“If he joins his imaginary thumb with the two
imaginary fingers beside it—he is wrong.... A
man who crosses himself that way will be condemned
to eternal damnation.... Cursed be he in
this life and he will have no lot in the next.”</p>

<p>These violent and harsh words, suddenly falling
upon the crowd which had just quieted down,
changed its mood.</p>

<p>It became excited, began to murmur, separate<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_200" id="Page_200">[200]</a></span>
into smaller groups. A black-eyed, black-haired
merchant, who had maintained hitherto an obstinate
silence, now struck his fist on the table and
said with a flash of his deepset and enthusiastic
eyes:</p>

<p>“True! The Devil Kuka and his whole crew are
in that cursed cross with the thumb and the fingers
next to it.”</p>

<p>“No, stop!” shouted the Orthodox, “don’t
insult the true cross! Why do you separate the
Three Persons, c-curses on you?... This is the
Trinity in these three fingers....”</p>

<p>“Where are your first fingers?”</p>

<p>“Merchant, have you read the hundred and fifth
article?”</p>

<p>“Yes, it’s on the end of the world.”</p>

<p>Dmitry Parfentyevich remained the centre of the
group. He was still composed and calm, but each
time when he answered any of his opponents, he
transfixed him with a stubborn and unfriendly
glance.</p>

<p>With splashing wheels, the steamboat steadily
ascended the river and cleft the blue surface of
the stream; it carried with it this group of violently
quarreling people and the clay slopes of the steep
bank reëchoed their confused voices.</p>

<p>A steep mountain, which had concealed a bend<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_201" id="Page_201">[201]</a></span>
in the river, now receded to the rear and a broad
sweep of the river appeared in front. The sun
hung like a red ball above the water and from the
east, darkness spread over the meadows as if on the
soft wingbeats of the evening shadows, overtaking
the boat and falling more and more noticeably over
the Volga.</p>

<h4>IV</h4>

<p>The silent group of Tatars suddenly rose from
their places in the stern and with even step moved
to the paddle box at the edge of the upper deck.
They took off their coats and spread them on the
deck. Then they took off their slippers and reverently
stepped upon their coats. The glow of the
sunset fell upon the rough faces of the Tatars.
Their thickset figures were sharply outlined against
the light and cooling heavens.</p>

<p>“They’re praying,” one man whispered and several
left the quarreling group and walked to the
railing.</p>

<p>Others followed. The argument quieted down.</p>

<p>The Tatars stood with their eyes closed, their
brows were raised and their thoughts were apparently
lifted up to that place where the last rays of
daylight were fading on the heights. At times they<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_202" id="Page_202">[202]</a></span>
unlocked their arms which were crossed on their
breasts and placed them on their knees, and then
they bowed their heads with their sheepskin caps,
low, so low. They arose again and stretched their
hands with the fingers extended toward the light.</p>

<p>The lips of the Moslems were whispering the
words of an unknown and unintelligible prayer....</p>

<p>“Look there,” said one peasant, and he stopped
hesitatingly, without expressing his thought.</p>

<p>“They are fulfilling the rites of their religion,”
asserted another.</p>

<p>“Yes, they’re praying too....”</p>

<p>The Tatars suddenly knelt, touched their foreheads
to the deck, and at once rose again. The
three young men took their coats and slippers and
went back to their former seats on the stern. The
old man was left alone. He sat with his feet
crossed under him. His lips moved and over his
beautiful face with its gray beard passed a strange
and touching expression of deep sorrow softened
by reverence before the will of the Most High.
His hands quickly fingered his beads.</p>

<p>“See.... He has beads too.”</p>

<p>“A zealous man....”</p>

<p>“Yes, it’s for his son.... He died in Astrakhan,”
explained the merchant who had gone down
the river with the Tatars.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_203" id="Page_203">[203]</a></span></p>

<p>“Oh, oh, oh!” sighed one of them philosophically.
“Every man wishes to be saved. No one
wishes to perish, whoever he is, even if he’s a
Tatar....”</p>

<p>It was too dark to tell who was speaking. The
group melted together but the isolated figure of the
old man still at his devotions could be seen at the
edge of the paddle box above the water. He was
silently swaying backwards and forwards.</p>

<p>“Papa!” suddenly came a soft voice.</p>

<p>It was Grunya calling her father.</p>

<p>“What is it, daughter?”</p>

<p>The girl was silent for a moment; she kept looking
at that praying figure of the adherent of an
alien faith, and then her young and eager voice
clearly sounded through the quiet:</p>

<p>“Please, ... what do you think: will God hear
that prayer?”</p>

<p>Grunya spoke softly, but all heard her. It
seemed as if a light breeze had passed along the
deck and in more than one soul the question of
the pale girl found response: will God hear that
prayer?</p>

<p>All were silent.... Their eyes involuntarily
turned upward, as if they wished to follow in the
blue of the evening sky the invisible flight of that
strange and unintelligible but beautiful prayer....</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_204" id="Page_204">[204]</a></span></p>

<p>“Why won’t He?...” came the irresolutely
soft words of a good-natured peasant. “You see,
he’s not praying to any one else. There’s only one
God.”</p>

<p>“Yes, the Father. You see, he’s looking to
heaven.”</p>

<p>“Who knows, who knows?...”</p>

<p>“It’s a hard question—the ways of the
Lord....”</p>

<p>A block creaked at the bow, the light of a golden
star flew to the top of the mast; the waves splashed
somewhere in the darkness; the distant whistle of
an almost invisible steamboat reëchoed above the
sleeping river. In the sky the bright stars appeared
one after the other, and the blue night hung noiselessly
above the meadows, the mountains and the
ravines of the Volga.</p>

<p>The earth seemed to be sadly asking some question
but the heavens remained silent with its quiet
and its mystery....</p>

<h3>THE VILLAGE OF GOD</h3>

<p class="center">(A SKETCH FROM A TRAVELER’S NOTEBOOK)</p>

<h4>I</h4>

<p class="dropcap">Early one summer morning I put my knapsack
on my shoulders and set out from
Arzamas.</p>

<p>Southeast of the city stretched the slopes of a
green mountain. A little white church welcomingly
and mildly peered out through the trees which grew
in large numbers among the graves and beside the
cemetery on the pitted sides of the mountain were
some strange white spots....</p>

<p>As I drew near I saw that these were small
and almost toy houses of old brick with peaked
roofs covered with mosses and lichens. Three were
shorter than a man,—one, in the form of a chapel,
was taller. The roofs supported eight-pointed
crosses, and on the walls were the dark boards of
ikons. The faces had been worn away by the winds
and beaten by the rains.</p>

<p>I was told in Arzamas that these were all that<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_208" id="Page_208">[208]</a></span>
was left of a unique village. In earlier times the
entire mountainside had been covered with similar
structures, as if a city of dwarfs had been laid out
opposite to the real city with its gigantic churches
and its monastery. The people called this place
the “Village of God.”</p>

<p>Every year, on the Thursday of the Seventh
Week after Easter the local clergy come to this
mountain and wave their censers in the air amid
these peculiar houses; the incense perfumes the
place and the choir sings:</p>

<p>“Remember, Lord, Thy slaughtered servants and
those who died an unknown death, whose names,
O Lord, Thou knowest....”</p>

<p>For whom they pray, for whom they sing the
requiem, whose sinful souls are remembered in this
prayer,—neither the people of Arzamas who stand
around and pray nor the clergy of Arzamas can
tell definitely.... For them the service in the
disappearing “village” is merely a pious and revered
custom, a relic of the hoary past....</p>

<p>And this past was sad and bloodstained....</p>

<p>Arzamas was once on the frontier. The city
guarded the border. The breeze which raised the
dust on the distant steppes here roused great
anxiety and alarm. Some looked toward the
steppes with terror, others with uneasy hopes....<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_209" id="Page_209">[209]</a></span>
And every spark borne hither on the winds from
the Don or the Volga, found here a goodly supply
of inflammable material in oppression, violence,
injustice, slavery, and grievous national suffering.</p>

<p>This was the soil where was planted the Village
of God.</p>

<h4>II</h4>

<p>It began, according to tradition, in the days of
Stepan Timofeyevich Razin.... The workmen of
Stenka robbed even in Arzamas. They fled from
here to the north of Nizhny Novgorod, nested for
a while in the village of Bolshoye Murashkino, and
then passed on to Lyskovo and Makary. At their
heels came the generals of the tsar and the bloody
vengeance of the followers of Razin was followed
by the not less bloody vengeance of the tsar.</p>

<p>During Peter’s reign in 1708, Kondrashka
Bulavin sent from the free Don his “pleasant
letters.” “Young atamans, lovers of travel, free
people of every class, thieves and robbers! He
who wishes to go with the military campaigning
ataman Kondraty Afanasyevich Bulavin, he who
wishes to raid with him, to travel gloriously, drink
and eat as he will, ride over the open fields on fine
horses, let him come to the black mountains of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_210" id="Page_210">[210]</a></span>
Samara.” ... So wrote the rebellious ataman to
the Cossacks of the Don, to the Ukraine, and the
Zaporozhian Syech. Along the Volga, through
cities north and south, to worthy commanders, flew
the message and also to the villages and towns. In
long and business-like letters, carefully composed
with a view to their political effect, he set forth all
the oppressions of nobles and magnates, all the
wrongs and injustice under which the land had long
been suffering. The appeals of Kondrashka inflamed
the whole land, more blood was shed, and
savage was the vengeance of the people.... Again
from Moscow advanced the regiments of troops in
accordance with the terrible order of Tsar Peter:</p>

<p>“ ... Go through the cities and villages which
have joined the robbers, burn them to the last
straw, slay the people and torture the leaders on
wheel and stake.... For this plague cannot be
removed, except by sternness....”</p>

<p>In those days there was no lack of sternness
and after the pacification even the cruel tsar wrote
to Dolgoruky, not to execute the brother of the
slain Bulavin, for many had joined the revolt from
misapprehension or “from compulsion.”</p>

<p>The rebels were carried to Arzamas. Scaffolds,
stakes, and wheels were erected along the roads
and the city during one of these periods of vengeance<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_211" id="Page_211">[211]</a></span>
was, in the words of an eye-witness quoted
by Solovyev, “like hell”; for more than a week
the groans of the victims of the terrible tortures
filled the air and birds of prey hung over the places
of execution.</p>

<p>After this pacification arose on the mountainside
houses of the “Village of God,” and the people
began to sing the requiems on the hillside....</p>

<p>Ere long the bone of the followers of Razin and
of Bulavin were joined by the bones of the banished
Stryeltsi (Guards).... Defiantly and in
disobedience to the tsar’s order, they left Vekikiya
Luki, whither they had been sent, and they stoutly
resisted the tsar’s General, Shein, with a large
force, but they were defeated in a desperate hand-to-hand
encounter, as they were trying to cut their
way through to Moscow to the Stryeltsi villages
where their wives and children were living. The
victorious general filled the prisons and dungeons
of Arzamas with the men who had disobeyed the
tsar’s orders. The ring-leaders were punished.
The tsar returning from abroad was dissatisfied
with the weakness and the mildness shown by Shein
to the rebels. A judge was sent from Moscow to
make a new investigation.... There were not
enough executioners in the city to administer the
new tortures and punishments and more had to be<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_212" id="Page_212">[212]</a></span>
summoned from Moscow for the occasion....</p>

<p>New houses were added to the “Village of
God.” ...</p>

<p>Drenched with blood, the naïve and rebellious
dream of the people for a free life died away until
new outbreaks commenced, a dream closely connected
with the old cross and the beard, with Cossack
bands, and with confused memories of the
freedom of the steppes. The old injustice weighed
more and more heavily upon them and hardened
and increased their century-old suffering. The
memory of the people involuntarily returned to
those who promised freedom and who sealed this
promise with their own and others’ blood....
Time and time again, like stones washed down to
the shore by the raging torrent, new groups of
“houses of God” appeared on the slopes of the
mountain of Arzamas.</p>

<p>At first, perhaps, each grave preserved the memory
of a definite man, his name, and his saint on an
ikon. Some one would bring these ikons and
sprinkle the tombs of shame with passionate tears
of love and sympathy. These mourners died....
The wind, the rains, and the sun faded the faces
on the ikons, and along with these there perished
the living personal memory of the people buried
here. There remained hanging above the mountain<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_213" id="Page_213">[213]</a></span>
only a vague tradition and a vague popular
feeling, ... a feeling of sad inability to comprehend,
which dared not pronounce its own judgment
and presented this to heaven.... And down
the centuries, from year to year, even to our own
times, sounds the solemn prayer for all those who
had been put to death, be they innocent or guilty,
and for all those who died an unknown death....</p>

<p>... Whose names, O Lord, Thou knowest....</p>

<h4>III</h4>

<p>I heard the following tale in Arzamas.</p>

<p>It was after the suppression of the rebellion of
Razin. The tsar’s generals had erected near
Arzamas a whole forest of columns with cross-beams
and towards evening the city saw in horror,
as they looked from one hill to another, hanging
upon them the bodies of atamans and of the men
of Arzamas who had joined the revolt. The bloody
sun set behind the mountain, fearful darkness covered
the heavens, and crows swarmed in clouds
around their booty. The people kept asking one
another: “Who is hanging there on the mountain?
Criminals and murderers or the defenders of popular
freedom, the avengers of century-old injustices?”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_214" id="Page_214">[214]</a></span></p>

<p>That same night a young merchant of Arzamas
was driving his tired horse along the road from
Saratov and he was urging it on with all his might.
He abandoned far from the city his cart and the
wares which he was bringing from the Volga, and
was hurrying ahead without resting at all; he had
learned from fugitives whom he had met that there
was something wrong in the city and that the men
of Razin were rioting in it. And he had left in
the city his father and mother and his young wife
with her first-born babe.</p>

<p>At midnight the young man galloped on his
foaming horse out of the forest on to a hill in sight
of his natal city. There was no gleam of fire to be
seen above the city, no alarm bells to be heard. The
city seemed dead; but in two or three of the
churches were there timid lights,—perchance by
the dead bodies of “honorable citizens,” who were
waiting Christian burial....</p>

<p>Suddenly ... his horse started.... It was at
that very place where now stand the “houses of
God.” ... The merchant saw a dread and leafless
forest standing on the mountain side, and, like
ripe fruit, the bodies of good young men hanging
on the trees, with crows flapping their wings and
picking out the eyes of the dead.</p>

<p>The young merchant’s heart had been surging<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_215" id="Page_215">[215]</a></span>
with uncertainty and sorrow during his hurried
journey by day and night, uninterrupted save by
the need of changing his tired horses, and his soul
was weighted down as by a rock with his hatred for
the rebels of Razin. He stopped his horse under
one scaffold, rose in his stirrups and with all his
strength he lashed one of the dead bodies and
cursed it.... The body swayed.... The chain
creaked and a cloud of crows rose in the air, flapping
and cawing.</p>

<p>A dreadful result followed: the tortured dead
descended from every scaffold, from every wheel,
and from every hook and rushed at the merchant....
The maddened horse tore through the fields,
leaped the ravines, and reached the city utterly exhausted.
And throughout the whole flight, like
autumn leaves driven by a gale, dashed after him
the shades of the executed, with their dead eyes
aflame, and their fettered hands grasped after him
with curses and moans, and their dead voices wailed,
lamented, cursed....</p>

<p>Then the merchant realized that it was not for
him to judge those who were now standing before
a far different tribunal, pleading there their own
and others’ sins, their own and others’ wrongs,
their own and others’ blood. In that dreadful
hour he took a solemn oath to bury all those who<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_216" id="Page_216">[216]</a></span>
had been executed and yearly to have a requiem
for them.</p>

<p>Since then, it is said that the houses of God
have stood in Arzamas. Since then the clergy sing
the requiem over the nameless graves and the ikons
which have been brought hither do not perish
unnoticed....</p>

<h4>IV</h4>

<p>It was a clear, calm morning when I went out
to the remains of the Village of God. A tired
woman who was driving a lost cow crossed herself,
when she saw the cross of the chapel. A gang of
workmen, “panniers” of Arzamas, were going to
their work. A very old peasant, gray as an owl
and with faded but still living eyes, was sitting on
the threshold of the chapel and binding the flaps of
his rough boots. The sun had just risen above
the distant forests.</p>

<p>“Greetings, grandsir,” I said to the old man.</p>

<p>“Good morning, son.... Where’re you going?”</p>

<p>“To Sarov.”</p>

<p>“You’re on the wrong road. There’s the proper
way.... To the bridge and then the village
there.”</p>

<p>“I know, grandsir. I left the road on purpose,
so as to see the houses of God.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_217" id="Page_217">[217]</a></span></p>

<p>“Look, son, look.... And pray here too....
It’s a holy place, you know....”</p>

<p>“Don’t you know who’s buried here?”</p>

<p>“Yes, son, yes! People of every class.... Violence!...
A Saltykov, a landowner from the
Vyyezdnaya Sloboda, who oppressed the people,—God
forbid.”</p>

<p>The old man sadly shook his gray beard.</p>

<p>“You know, old people say,—a merchant was
going from Makary to Arzamas,—and offered
thanksgiving for arriving safely. Glory to God—he
was at home! At dawn he went out of the city
peacefully and met the lord and his retainers on
the bridge. There was no justice.... They
hurled him from the bridge into the Tesha and in
a day or two his body floated to the city.... It
was picked up and buried here, on the mountain.
And here it lies till the Day of Judgment....”</p>

<p>I was already familiar with the name of this
Saltykov: the old records in the archives of Nizhny
Novgorod preserve the dark memories of the acts
of this noble family, and one is well known from
the revolt of Pugachev: his retainers collected the
taxes by robbery. When the glad tidings spread
among the people that Petr Fedorovich had made
himself known and was marching to recover his
throne, the serfs of Saltykov thought that there<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_218" id="Page_218">[218]</a></span>
would be an end to their master’s outrages and
their necessarily sinful lives. The mir assembled,
seized and bound their lord, put him in a cart
and took him to the “tsar’s camp” for trial.
“But,” said one landowner who described the incident,
“the Lord heard the prayers of the innocent
victim and the rascals instead of going to the camp
of the pretender, carried him to the troops of
Mikhelson.”</p>

<p>It goes without saying that the kindly nobleman
was quickly released and the wicked peasants
received just punishment. Their bones perhaps
joined those of the followers of Bulavin, the Stryeltsi
and the victims of this same Saltykov. They
all lie there together awaiting “the judgment of
God” over all earthly actions....</p>

<p>“Yes, there’s the Sloboda,” said the old man,
rising to his feet and pointing to the village with
its columns of smoke and with the morning fog
across the river Tesha. “And there, higher up,
were the gardens of Saltykov....”</p>

<p>“Do you think these houses of God were built
since, grandsir?” I asked.</p>

<p>“N-no, friend! Since! N-no.... Much earlier....
Perhaps since Pugachev.”</p>

<p>“Who was Pugachev?”</p>

<p>“Who knows, we are dark people. We heard<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_219" id="Page_219">[219]</a></span>
from our fathers and grandfathers nothing but
Pugachev and Pugachev.... You know the old
story. My father died forty years ago and he was
ninety years old when he died.... And he was
still a boy when Pugachev appeared. Count now,
how long ago it was.”</p>

<p>“A hundred and twenty years, grandsir.”</p>

<p>“Yes, a hundred and twenty,—and more!...
Pugachev was a stern man. Oh, so stern. You
know, he didn’t love the landowners. He’d go into
a village. ‘Give me your lords!’ If the peasants
hid them,—God forbid! Cruel.... My father,
God bless him, once told me there were two villages
side by side. The people of one guessed right.
They took the ikon and went to meet him, ringing
the bells. He pardoned them, rewarded them, gave
them a charter of his favor.... Ours didn’t;
the fools didn’t meet him and he burned the whole
village.”</p>

<p>The old man suddenly looked at me, saw my
watchchain and the notebook in which I began to
jot down the main points of his story,—and he
suddenly took off his cap and said:</p>

<p>“Forgive me, for Christ’s sake!”</p>

<p>“What’s the matter, grandsir?”</p>

<p>“That wasn’t so, perhaps.... We’re dark
people; how should we know?... Perhaps he<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_220" id="Page_220">[220]</a></span>
never said it.... But it is true that he was stern....
He loved order....”</p>

<p>The old man seemed to be afraid that the gentleman
would condemn him for familiar stories
about the high qualities of Pugachev, who “loved
order” and issued “charters of his favor”....</p>

<p>I succeeded in calming his anxiety, and we continued
to talk. The old man proved communicative.
His memory kept much curious lore and
his simple answers revealed that same vague
atmosphere which filled the place: a feeling of
pardoning and timid lack of comprehension, of
vague questioning and of prayer for those who
lie here, under the earth, and perchance had been
executed as punishment for crime or perchance had
laid down their lives for a cause punishable here
on earth but counted holy and righteous <i>there</i>.</p>

<p>The group of workmen stopped along with me
to hear the almost forgotten traditions connected
with this spot.</p>

<h4>V</h4>

<p>We went together into the little chapel. Its
walls were covered with regiments of ikons, and
at the eastern end was a crucifix also surrounded
by ikons. Gloomy faces, dark boards, bereft of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_221" id="Page_221">[221]</a></span>
heads.... Oh, so many were lacking heads....
As if the vague feeling of the simple offerers had
sought thus to express their feeling that the punishments
were undeserved....</p>

<p>I was especially surprised by one ikon, of a crucifix
painted on the cubical base. It was not old or
had perhaps been renewed and it might well have
been a piece of individual workmanship inspired
by the sadness of this place. On a semi-circular hill
with no attempt at perspective could be seen a
severed hand with compressed fingers. Beside it
were huge nails. Hammer and saw were hanging
in the air. Fragments of chains.... A column
with a bundle of rods and whips fastened to it were
painted against a background of whirling clouds.
But a faint light pierced the clouds and penetrated
the mists like a faint gleam of hope. And as if to
emphasize this idea more clearly, the artist had depicted
a cock greeting the sunrise.... On the
top of the column the bird was standing with vibrating
wings and open beak, welcoming the morning....</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>Silently we left the chapel. Although the interior
was not dark,—yet it seemed to me that in
passing out through this low door we were passing
from deep gloom into the light of a clear sky.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_222" id="Page_222">[222]</a></span></p>

<p>Directly ahead of me little heads of grain waved
their brilliant wings as if they were alive. The
churches and monasteries of Arzamas, like lace,
gleamed on the neighboring mountain. The
Vyyezdnaya Sloboda with its little church looked
down beautifully into the Tesha.</p>

<p>“Oh, God,” sighed one of the peasants deeply
and slowly.</p>

<p>What did this sigh express? I do not know.
Was it a consciousness of the difficult conditions
of life for the workingmen at this present time?
Or was it a feeling that, no matter how hard conditions
were now, yet it was better to live in the
present than in the gloomy night of the past?...
I thought it was the second idea.</p>

<p>We parted and each went his own way.</p>

1.C. The Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation ("the
Foundation" or PGLAF), owns a compilation copyright in the collection
of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works. Nearly all the individual
works in the collection are in the public domain in the United
States. If an individual work is unprotected by copyright law in the
United States and you are located in the United States, we do not
claim a right to prevent you from copying, distributing, performing,
displaying or creating derivative works based on the work as long as
all references to Project Gutenberg are removed. Of course, we hope
that you will support the Project Gutenberg-tm mission of promoting
free access to electronic works by freely sharing Project Gutenberg-tm
works in compliance with the terms of this agreement for keeping the
Project Gutenberg-tm name associated with the work. You can easily
comply with the terms of this agreement by keeping this work in the
same format with its attached full Project Gutenberg-tm License when
you share it without charge with others.

1.D. The copyright laws of the place where you are located also govern
what you can do with this work. Copyright laws in most countries are
in a constant state of change. If you are outside the United States,
check the laws of your country in addition to the terms of this
agreement before downloading, copying, displaying, performing,
distributing or creating derivative works based on this work or any
other Project Gutenberg-tm work. The Foundation makes no
representations concerning the copyright status of any work in any
country outside the United States.

1.E.1. The following sentence, with active links to, or other
immediate access to, the full Project Gutenberg-tm License must appear
prominently whenever any copy of a Project Gutenberg-tm work (any work
on which the phrase "Project Gutenberg" appears, or with which the
phrase "Project Gutenberg" is associated) is accessed, displayed,
performed, viewed, copied or distributed:

  This eBook is for the use of anyone anywhere in the United States and
  most other parts of the world at no cost and with almost no
  restrictions whatsoever. You may copy it, give it away or re-use it
  under the terms of the Project Gutenberg License included with this
  eBook or online at www.gutenberg.org. If you are not located in the
  United States, you'll have to check the laws of the country where you
  are located before using this ebook.

1.E.2. If an individual Project Gutenberg-tm electronic work is
derived from texts not protected by U.S. copyright law (does not
contain a notice indicating that it is posted with permission of the
copyright holder), the work can be copied and distributed to anyone in
the United States without paying any fees or charges. If you are
redistributing or providing access to a work with the phrase "Project
Gutenberg" associated with or appearing on the work, you must comply
either with the requirements of paragraphs 1.E.1 through 1.E.7 or
obtain permission for the use of the work and the Project Gutenberg-tm
trademark as set forth in paragraphs 1.E.8 or 1.E.9.

1.E.3. If an individual Project Gutenberg-tm electronic work is posted
with the permission of the copyright holder, your use and distribution
must comply with both paragraphs 1.E.1 through 1.E.7 and any
additional terms imposed by the copyright holder. Additional terms
will be linked to the Project Gutenberg-tm License for all works
posted with the permission of the copyright holder found at the
beginning of this work.

License terms from this work, or any files containing a part of this
work or any other work associated with Project Gutenberg-tm.

1.E.5. Do not copy, display, perform, distribute or redistribute this
electronic work, or any part of this electronic work, without

Gutenberg-tm License.

1.E.6. You may convert to and distribute this work in any binary,

to or distribute copies of a Project Gutenberg-tm work in a format
other than "Plain Vanilla ASCII" or other format used in the official
version posted on the official Project Gutenberg-tm web site
(www.gutenberg.org), you must, at no additional cost, fee or expense
to the user, provide a copy, a means of exporting a copy, or a means

Vanilla ASCII" or other form. Any alternate format must include the
full Project Gutenberg-tm License as specified in paragraph 1.E.1.

  the use of Project Gutenberg-tm works calculated using the method
  you already use to calculate your applicable taxes. The fee is owed
  to the owner of the Project Gutenberg-tm trademark, but he has
  agreed to donate royalties under this paragraph to the Project
  Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation. Royalty payments must be paid
  within 60 days following each date on which you prepare (or are
  legally required to prepare) your periodic tax returns. Royalty

  Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation at the address specified in
  Section 4, "Information about donations to the Project Gutenberg
  Literary Archive Foundation."

* You provide a full refund of any money paid by a user who notifies
  you in writing (or by e-mail) within 30 days of receipt that s/he
  does not agree to the terms of the full Project Gutenberg-tm
  License. You must require such a user to return or destroy all
  copies of the works possessed in a physical medium and discontinue
  all use of and all access to other copies of Project Gutenberg-tm
  works.

* You provide, in accordance with paragraph 1.F.3, a full refund of
  any money paid for a work or a replacement copy, if a defect in the

  distribution of Project Gutenberg-tm works.

1.E.9. If you wish to charge a fee or distribute a Project

from both the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation and The
Project Gutenberg Trademark LLC, the owner of the Project Gutenberg-tm
trademark. Contact the Foundation as set forth in Section 3 below.

1.F.

1.F.1. Project Gutenberg volunteers and employees expend considerable
effort to identify, do copyright research on, transcribe and proofread
works not protected by U.S. copyright law in creating the Project
Gutenberg-tm collection. Despite these efforts, Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic works, and the medium on which they may be stored, may
contain "Defects," such as, but not limited to, incomplete, inaccurate
or corrupt data, transcription errors, a copyright or other
intellectual property infringement, a defective or damaged disk or
other medium, a computer virus, or computer codes that damage or
cannot be read by your equipment.

1.F.2. LIMITED WARRANTY, DISCLAIMER OF DAMAGES - Except for the "Right
of Replacement or Refund" described in paragraph 1.F.3, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation, the owner of the Project
Gutenberg-tm trademark, and any other party distributing a Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic work under this agreement, disclaim all
liability to you for damages, costs and expenses, including legal
fees. YOU AGREE THAT YOU HAVE NO REMEDIES FOR NEGLIGENCE, STRICT
LIABILITY, BREACH OF WARRANTY OR BREACH OF CONTRACT EXCEPT THOSE
PROVIDED IN PARAGRAPH 1.F.3. YOU AGREE THAT THE FOUNDATION, THE
TRADEMARK OWNER, AND ANY DISTRIBUTOR UNDER THIS AGREEMENT WILL NOT BE
LIABLE TO YOU FOR ACTUAL, DIRECT, INDIRECT, CONSEQUENTIAL, PUNITIVE OR
INCIDENTAL DAMAGES EVEN IF YOU GIVE NOTICE OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH
DAMAGE.

defect in this electronic work within 90 days of receiving it, you can
receive a refund of the money (if any) you paid for it by sending a

received the work on a physical medium, you must return the medium
with your written explanation. The person or entity that provided you
with the defective work may elect to provide a replacement copy in
lieu of a refund. If you received the work electronically, the person
or entity providing it to you may choose to give you a second
opportunity to receive the work electronically in lieu of a refund. If
the second copy is also defective, you may demand a refund in writing
without further opportunities to fix the problem.

1.F.4. Except for the limited right of replacement or refund set forth
in paragraph 1.F.3, this work is provided to you 'AS-IS', WITH NO

1.F.5. Some states do not allow disclaimers of certain implied
warranties or the exclusion or limitation of certain types of
damages. If any disclaimer or limitation set forth in this agreement
violates the law of the state applicable to this agreement, the
agreement shall be interpreted to make the maximum disclaimer or
limitation permitted by the applicable state law. The invalidity or
unenforceability of any provision of this agreement shall not void the
remaining provisions.

trademark owner, any agent or employee of the Foundation, anyone
providing copies of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works in
accordance with this agreement, and any volunteers associated with the
production, promotion and distribution of Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic works, harmless from all liability, costs and expenses,
including legal fees, that arise directly or indirectly from any of
the following which you do or cause to occur: (a) distribution of this
or any Project Gutenberg-tm work, (b) alteration, modification, or
additions or deletions to any Project Gutenberg-tm work, and (c) any
Defect you cause.

Section 2. Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg-tm

Project Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of
computers including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers. It
exists because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations
from people in all walks of life.

Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need are critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm's
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will
remain freely available for generations to come. In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future
generations. To learn more about the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation and how your efforts and donations can help, see
Sections 3 and 4 and the Foundation information page at
www.gutenberg.org

Section 4. Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg
Literary Archive Foundation

Project Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide
spread public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment. Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.

The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States. Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements. We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance. To SEND
DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any particular
state visit www.gutenberg.org/donate

While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.

International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States. U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.

Please check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation
methods and addresses. Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including checks, online payments and credit card donations. To
donate, please visit: www.gutenberg.org/donate

Section 5. General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works.

Professor Michael S. Hart was the originator of the Project
Gutenberg-tm concept of a library of electronic works that could be
freely shared with anyone. For forty years, he produced and
distributed Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of
volunteer support.

Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as not protected by copyright in
the U.S. unless a copyright notice is included. Thus, we do not
necessarily keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper
edition.

Most people start at our Web site which has the main PG search
facility: www.gutenberg.org

This Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,
including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
subscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.
